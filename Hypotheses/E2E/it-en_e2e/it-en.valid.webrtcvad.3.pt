(Applause) (Music)
In 2016, I was given a prize, from the National Forum Forticing Learning.
I was sponsorized by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, from the name a little particular.
They are born in Church.
The motivation of this award was my availability in the confrontation of the students and my ability to create data environments.
Less formal, more relaxing, let's imagine that this is...
A big university class.
Of course, I'm in class.
The first ten minutes, when students enter and get there.
I put my computer to explain and put a classic music.
I think this is the first step.
To create less forming data environments, and try to keep attention to the students.
Unfortunately, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a method used at the end of the old age.
The storytelling.
At a pedagogical level, the storytelling is a method based on the use of narratives.
To transmit knowledge to students.
It's precisely with this method that I'd like to start my lesson on South America.
Let's explain to you, describing you a topic.
On the mouth of everyone, already.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that children tell, I'd like to start my story.
There was once.
Second World War.
1942.
The UK region.
Blockchain Park.
A...
The northern residence of London.
There was a young and 30 years old.
Alan Turing.
Lanziliario was the one who chose Cambridge.
And they get a research doctor in logic, the Princeton University in America.
In that period, the Tedes used a machine.
It's special.
It's enigma.
It was like a writing machine.
The operator digitalized details.
But let's stick on a paper.
In fact, those letters I stuck other letters, according to them.
A code imposed mechanically under the machine.
The texts used this mechanism to communicate with them.
Anyone would interceive this paper in front of you without any sense.
It was shouting.
Alan Turing.
One ...
One of the main figures in Blece Park.
Take a look and build them a machine.
It's the one you can see.
In other words, in order to decipher ...
This test is written by the TEDx.
For this invention, we think that war is finished with two years of anticipation.
It's saving many human quickly.
Alan Turing continues, after the war, to do its logical research.
And it's considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
With your Turing machine, he formalizes the concept of computer, even before the computer was created in practice.
In 1950, an article published on the "Mind magazine."
The computer in the machine is in intelligence.
Where does the test indicate?
The question behind the testing is a very precise.
They can think the machines.
From here on, artificial intelligence began.
Probably many of you have seen the movie "Madeashing game," the game of limitation, I want to explain to you.
Let's suppose there's a person here?
Digitality is the computer.
It requires questions, and on the other hand, a machine M.
It's an operator.
In an alternative way, the machine M and the opponent O.
They provide the answers to the person.
It's said that the machine M becomes overwhelming test.
If the person is not able to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the operator.
This is limiting a game.
The machine must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
You must interpret the natural language.
The question that comes from the person?
It must represent knowledge to form the answers.
It must think in an automatic way to form these answers.
And it must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence.
One of these is the cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this process, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to capture thinking.
In the moment they are.
Or we try to modify the thinking at a psychological level.
That's why artificial intelligence is extremely connected to cognitive neural sciences.
It's psychology.
According to this approach, the assignment that if we can really have a female representation of human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of the laws of rational thinking.
Probably many of you.
They've heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man.
All the men are mortal.
Socrates are mortal.
This is a deductive argument.
Take two premises.
Very good.
It's dedicated to a real conclusion: from here the logic of the whole, according to the approach of the legs of the thought.
We try to build educational arguments.
And to see them in a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational agents.
A rational agent?
An entity.
It must act.
It must be adapted to the context.
It must take them goals, and know how to take them to end.
And it must act in a rational way.
So TestD Turing is linked to intelligent people.
Riformulating the phrase of Turing can a machine think.
We can say, "Can we create a machine?"
An artificial agent.
I'm able to think.
To exhibit intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence, so it's at the purpose of creating artificial entities, intelligent.
Your phone is an entity.
Among the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence as psychological construct.
Once we have more knowledge.
That's it.
Isn't it?
It's close to build artificial, intelligent identity and support of man.
It's a title.
But let's see today.
If machines can think.
I'd like to explain to you to describe the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I'd like to use.
Five classes to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We have subtle agents.
For human beings.
Sovereignity.
Superhuman.
Finally, we have optimal agents.
Let's take this with another example.
Other animals are those people who act better than all men and can't do better.
For example, people who used the cube of Rubik play a four-year-old strength in the best way, play a sad, think that a few years ago a young man has rescued.
It was the beginning of the Rubik cube.
It has resulted in 4.73 seconds.
A few months ago, they created an agent, a robot that was able to solve in zero.63 seconds.
Do we have the sovereign people?
Do they act better than all people?
For example, in the game of the rocks.
In the game of the scarce.
A few years ago, the camp ...
Russian diskis, Gaspar Paisato, knocked from a artificial agent.
We have people who suffer humans, those who manage almost like all people.
For example, in the game of the little craft.
I'll answer the question of the kiss.
We used to stop the mind.
What do they act?
Almost like all people.
For example?
In cognitive activities, like the words are crossed.
Or the classification of the image?
Finally, we have subtle people who manage the worst of all people.
Exemples are the classification of objects.
The recognition of calligraphy, the vocal recognition, the translation of a language to the other.
But if there's something that artificial agents, today, are not able to do, for example, is disambiguation.
We're talking about the result.
How?
The mum.
Are we talking?
From the Mark of Apple Corporation.
And one thing that agents are not able to do is reasoning in the ideal world.
The uncertainty situation.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence, so you think we are far from overcoming the test.
Let's see now in the future.
They will be able to think the machines.
A few years ago.
Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest Americans, was introduced a concept from the name of technological singularity.
Experts of artificial intelligence in the world.
Imagine the line of time.
Imagine a line.
That indicates the human intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a red line that indicates the machine intelligence.
With an exponential environment.
This is a blind moment.
Landing.
I predicted it in the wall's leg.
So?
Complexity, for example, measured with the number of transistors inside a chip.
It's been taken for two years and in four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to...
It's part of this complexity with a computer to simulate the human brain.
I don't see anything.
In 2020 we would have access to 1,000 dolls to this computer capacity.
In 2025, secondary and crossed, I'll never be able to get rid of our brain in a precise way.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will pass the test, they will overcome the test.
And then?
In 2045 and India, the moment in which technology singularity will have.
In which machines will follow the intelligence of the machines will follow an exponential environment that will radically change.
Human intelligence.
In his article.
It's published on the Mind journal.
The tourists not only proposed their tests.
It also proposes new objections.
Contering your same test.
These objections are us against artificial intelligence.
Four years ago?
The student is the University of Varese.
I followed a path of epistemology, deontology and ethics of computer science, came from ...
A decade, a teacher Gaithan, Aurélio Lanzerone, unfortunately a few years ago, one of the compounds we had to move was to propose.
Contract the test of Twing.
I'll tell you about artificial intelligence.
And I was the only thing I wanted to propose.
A decade formulated, mathematical communication.
"What about human stupidity?"
Do you want to describe it in simple terminals, do we suppose to take the intelligence of all people?
Let's put the seed.
The symbol of submission to the minister side of the equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
Coño had love.
An equality of intelligence.
But in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were us?
To transfer our intelligence inside a machine.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we left the machine become more intelligent than us.
So to conclude my story.
Let's start with the initial question.
They can think the machines.
I'd like to leave you.
With an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you (Applause)
(Music) (Music)
(Applause)
Good afternoon.
(Applause)
But how many of you today have taken pictures?
Thank you.
OK, this gives me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in the bathroom.
I've spent the last three years, so many pictures of photography, and I'm a journalist who takes care of photography, I'm the creative director of a study that takes care of photography, and I'm a person who does absolutely me a photographer.
This is me, immersed among my maps, to take care of a liquid matter, the photography, which is the product and broadcast through the cell phone.
Her limits, their contradictions, their potentialities, their impact on the market, their projectual and self-esteem, but there are many others, in which way the photographer changes the processes through which we communicate.
We can consider the photographer a new language for the influence of theesthetics of the vision that forms of compassion, the technological consciousness there is in the production of a scenario, in part of a professional photographer.
It's still the difference regarding the simple gesture of primary and pulseing on a smartphone.
And how does photography change the forms and the structure of professional photography to find answers to these questions I tried to open a confrontation?
With photos, rescuers, criticisms, theories that deserve the photographer to have a way to elaborate experiences and reflections.
But the professional photographers, instead, that for the first ten years, have embraced the challenge of this new means, I asked them to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the successes, of their shared and images through the cell phone.
(Applause)
To find answers, I looked around me.
And I arrived in New York, at the DSC of the photo editor of New York Times Magazing, in Cathy Ryan.
"A Berlin?"
In the AIM sede, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock.
In Parigi?
In the "Parifotto" room, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world.
To enter those places where photography is distributed, it's sold, it's in context, and understand how the photographer changes these engratulations.
(Applause)
To find answers, I tried to look beyond.
In addition to the surface of the great common places of the contemporary.
For example, selfie, the selfie to get involved, simply to a global narcissistic delirium, and to get into connection like some psychologists have sustained with the body dismorphism, or can't be seen as a health of seeds generation.
It's like an identical setting, like a overwhelming reappropriation of their own image, as it's joyfully reivindicated by the artist, feminist, like "Ketter Ben."
Or the Asho Lagger, the phyto-pintage aesthetics that has still segregated our mobile vision.
This is my channel, Zazi, a victim designed by my photographic experiments, and it's simply the result of a world's world's world's worldwide.
Nowadays, as the social sociologist was born in New Yorkson, it can't be read to the light of more complex factors, of nature itself.
Social, historical, even economical.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of answers, it's the territory of interpretations.
And from this phenomenon, I tried to give an interpretation to a book.
Because it's called "revolution," I mean, for a story of the photographer, because in front of the excessing image we're exposed, it seems to me to try to draw a map, if not to find the route, at least to understand what we are.
And how are we?
But the story of Mobile photography is short, but in a few years it has been around millions and millions of people.
A new code that exceeds every linguistic barrier, used daily to communicate, to test ourselves, to feed a constant flow of images that make individuals from an angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collective world, if you want, that has impressive numbers.
Every two minutes, today, we climb more images of how many Americans have taken in the burden of the year 20th century.
More than 350 million of these images are carried every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production and the diffusion of images, of activities that, until a few years ago, looked at a right search for professionals.
It became an instinctive of action of our daily experience.
A way of social interaction?
A channel of proof of our private sphere in the public dimension.
In which we define ourselves through the images we produce, or better, we exist because we produce images.
And if the photographer is a new language, then it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that is still strongly drawn by that structure, work, family, coppy, are always more fascinating, and here actors are unstably points in a universe in movement, sponsorships in front of the media of the messages that affect them daily.
The flow of the photographer looks like the form of more natural expression.
A liquid vision that is composed of compounds.
It's simply based on the instant gratification of our need for sharing.
But in a world where each one, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone.
What's the professional photographer?
And what difference does it happen for accidental and conscious photographs?
On the one hand, the facility of using the cell phone camera has transformed the photograph of mixing professionals the universal language.
Fortunately, with the process of democratization of photography, I started with the era Kodak and arrived until the iPhone.
On the other hand?
The use of cell phone as a reward tool offered to professional photographers.
Nine possibilities in approach to stories, to the contents, to the subjects.
Still, on one hand.
The opening to everyone, to all of us, of a dialogue channel, with a potentially global audience, has moved the professional photographer of their exclusive void.
Like a producer of images.
It has put them in crisis the social function, the economic position.
We just need to think of the rule that had the photographer and social network in the first Arab Spring.
To prove that being a powerful tool to orient public opinion is a capture of machines and information, difficultly controlled by the regions.
This is an image of Pensiti, a show that the Folfang museum of SN has dedicated to the rule of the photographer Mobile.
It's the first Arab war.
On the other hand, right?
Let's think that the possibility of direct interaction through the web, through Instagram, between the photographer and the audience, has liberated the photographer from the obliged passage.
For the hands of the editor, the liberated by the need to undertake a political agenda, a editorial line detected by others, and not always based on journalist priorities.
I've liberated it from the impossibility of reaching the destinies of their own message if it doesn't cross traditional channels, like seeds, megae, daily, galleries, access and limited resources.
And he allowed them to put themselves directly in the use of the news, traveling.
Do you keep visits in real time, a particularly interesting example?
The offer is the Mega-Zenthim, in 2012, with the cover of Instagram photography, and it can directly be found by a American photographer, Research and Courniz, and dedicated to the conservation of the universal heritage of the T-COV photographer and society in the 90s.
Or, they are born.
Nine paths of curatory selection, like 1415 mobile photographers, created by those Italian photographers, Giulio Napolitan and George Poswick, through a job of scalp in the highest and narrative accounts around a topic.
But then are the photographs that in the last years have operated this tool with a great authority awareness?
I'm photos like Michael Cristophe Brown.
Benjamin Loui.
Orona Vib, who have used and use the smartphone of conflicts, showing how the agility and the description of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of depth.
Photography like Tero Quaiama, who, from a simple smartphone, has explored new paths for Newsmaking, creating a well-being platform to put in touch the American soldiers in the south of Afghanistan with their families, and to create a motor of information from the front of the first hand.
Bred Mengin, who used it for Sport's photography, exclusive territory of photographers with hyper-performant appearances, and made a vehicle of intimate narration in the middle of the basketball.
Research Cirnandt, who enjoyed discretion and manner for photography street, creating a very personalistic aesthetics.
I'll tell you that he made a small denouncement, going back to the American community of Brooklyn, and creating a community waiting for the parts around his job.
MTIX that uses it daily to build its family album, inerting a reflection on how Instagram changes the facts of our privacy, and the way we build and preserve our visual memory.
Peter of Campo, who, through the "ebrid of Africa," has shown how the photographer Mobile, far from limiting simply to generate waste and visits.
It could also be used to discuss.
It opens the most photo-personalistic stereotypes.
As they know Luigi, who has reinterpreted the Omer's disorder with the cell phone, telling in the AI series of six one of the oldest heritage of the history of the West.
With the new vision tool.
Or as I was born in Lourlin, who photographed the manifesting smooths in Piazza, who, during the protests of Midan, with a beautiful poetry, and contemporary scholarship.
Well, what do these photographs know how to do?
To tell, going to the outskirts of action, or looking for personalized tags on the event.
To avoid more than recording.
creating images that are never straightened to reality, but that are born from a deep interaction between photographers and contents to be broadcast on different platforms and reach different audiences.
To make network using the connections in an innovative way.
Putting on the authority exercise for their point of view on the world.
And on the quality of depth.
Because anyway, it's the tool of rewarding.
Only if the conceptuality and smiled by a lonely, articulated and in a coherent way.
It can be distinguished from the visible rumor of the bottom that offers us the eyes.
All of this, I believe, makes the difference between a photograph that was the real resource.
Her bullying, reproduction, her self-referent and sharing.
A photograph that can still be a cultural metaphor.
Thank you all.
(Applause)
(Alarm)
(Music) (Applause)
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
What we believe is to be silence.
Actually, there are 50 parts of the electric race.
Fifty-thirds that are immediately entered in our lives.
We wake up from the illusion that silence exists.
"Oh, but...
There is no.
So also in this room, those providers, these seeds.
It's putting a frequency of 50 HRS.
So, do you imagine yourself, don't go home after a job day, really stressful?
You eat, with your partner, with your partner, and then you're going to read in the bubble of your bedera.
And you think you're alone.
But no.
There's always the law.
This frequency of 50RS, which I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible in our homes, in our lives, but it's more or less this sound.
(Music)
We have a positive perspective, or better, first of the negative aspect.
The silence doesn't exist.
But we have a positive aspect.
We are never alone, that is, always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Very good, pregnant.
And if we look at it as a drawing, this frequency of 50 Ears is nothing more than a sound wave, a sound wave with a beautiful rich spectrum.
With which you can do music, and then I asked myself.
But why?
Why not make us music?
Well, I'm a composer of sound colonies, an artist, I'm now, or a little particular, why?
I was complicated life deciding to make music alone and exclusively through rumor.
My parents ...
They divorced when I was a child.
And I know, you think this is the classic story in Strappa Lacre, but it was the revelation of my life.
Because in loneliness, well.
From those days, in the weight of the void of that house, I started to make music with everything I surrounded you.
I said.
Each income complement was no longer.
A classic complement of network, we fermed, immobile, before the voice.
But it becomes my musical tool.
(Applause) Of course, every roof didn't find the bikes, among the other hand, Macciao, I'm looking at the streaming, this is a great revelation.
Of course, I say, at some point...
Someone will become a normal person, trying to say.
I tried because I started studying Chitarra.
They are strong piano.
Then I liked Woody Allen, so I started to create the grandson, the problem I really liked Arenzo Arvor, who wrote a unfortunately ambitious song.
I've been doing this for the first years of study in Genoa.
I also quit the Clarinetto.
It's good for not to go ...
It's easy to illusion my classmates.
But why did I abandon all this, why did I study and escape from that notation so rigid?
Because there's more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more sponsor in a rumor, and I like to paragonate it.
It has the problems of life.
All of us have attacked us.
A rumor, a failure, something that made us think, but I'm sure that this rumor made us grow much more.
From a smile.
So, what is my mission?
After when they're a child, it's to transform a failure, a rumor.
In music, it's to harmonize everything around me.
Do you have it?
I'll have everything, right?
I don't complain.
I'm going to make a beautiful turning point, Gino Paoli, and everything would be concluded, but no, I'm complicated in this way life.
What is it?
The sound.
But above all?
What is the study, and with the saying, is one of the most difficult senses to understand, but also the easiest, the most powerful.
To transmit an emotion.
Our internal eye, the protein of the oceans, our team, reaches the maximum functionality.
Around the fifth week of gesture.
I say, "Twenty weeks of gesture," this means that we start listening.
Before talking, we started to listen even before seeing.
This is not a case.
Because the fact must be ready.
I know that the hospital, in life, once was born, must be ready to the honor text, it shouldn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So, in a case, if the mother, during the pregnancy, listened to Panchroke British, didn't stop if the child once was born.
"Yes."
It will end up listening, for example, Sex Pistols.
So no.
Future, mum, I prepare you, and it's a richness that I personally make you attention to the musical choice: wait for the trap, more than another... OK... (Applause)
But what is sound?
"Yes."
The sound is that ...
It's all that we're surrounded, and sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what, in our lives, is completely abstract.
You don't see, you don't touch.
For me, the colony is time for every day, the rhythm in our partner, the mother who screams us, because the mother screams us, still, always.
All of this is the sound colony of our days.
That's it.
Of course, the visual is much easier.
We don't know.
The visual is when we enter the system's hair, we say.
It's smaller than how I imagined them.
There's more small than what, more small than the man of Milan?
The smaller than San Pietro?
The small one in your house, maybe?
It's understood the same as when a person sees me in video, or on stage, and then I tell you about people and says to you.
I imagined higher.
Of course, even because it's lower, it would be really impossible.
So ...
Going from this presentation.
Is it visible?
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's go!
To imagine our lives, I would like to genuine your ability to observe, so we are in vacation.
We started the sea, not in case, and we started to...
I have a soccer blog, who talks about soccer, kilometers Zero, kilometers, kilometers don't know, I'm not in the other side, then it's photo of low, but we don't do it, but we also do those, then there's the open air, so many sensory, but it's a lot of socks that had a certain point that had a certain point.
"Shut up!"
No one eating doll.
We photograph it.
We look at it.
Let's do many videos.
But we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I teach you a trick: when you put them with someone ...
The best moment to know the person is to stay in silence, that silence that, among the other, doesn't exist: go for two, and...
To listen.
Let's close.
And to listen.
Like in this moment.
So, today I'd like to take you with me.
It turns around the world, it was evolving.
Your perception of listening.
And I'd like to start by telling you...
The dream of my life.
The dream of my life is born.
From alcohol?
That's it.
For the first time, the listening of myself was 2013, I wanted to run away from the History, a series of failures, problems and others.
Because then they turned into harmony, but I think I'm going to look for a very far place in Italy.
So, I decided to choose.
A city on the screen.
There was the Atlantis, yes, it's true.
There was still a lot, there was one of the largest cities, culturally.
Artistically, and really far from me.
Shanghai decided to participate in a competition, I came to an artistic residence and started the most beautiful years of my life, for the simple fact that for the first time I was listening to myself.
So, I didn't have money, I had so much fear: I had an idea, but I was the only one to believe us, and it was the one that would have listened to the sounds of the whole world, of all the cities of the world, creating this project "Sound of Offsiti."
And the whole part, really, from the midst of the cities, are a great musical tool to wake up this musical tool, you can enter the last of the cities.
And I'd like to take you to this moment to Shanghai, where?
For 48 hours, I'm not registered the sounds of the city.
And I created a sound colony.
So, at this moment?
I want to sound to you.
Shanghai.
(Applause)
In Ivo Vadão, I'm experiencing that I'm the only one in the car.
It's an inhibition that will inspire me to be in the big corner.
In Evardo, the most specialist in the middle of the Christmas.
(Video) (English) I'm tired of the Big Bang, I'm tired of the air of the air.
(Video) (English) I'm a young man, I'm a young man, I'm a young man, I'm a young man, I'm a young man.
(Laughter)
(Music) (Alarm)
(Applause) (Cheers) Happy Birsty.
You were still focused on the visual.
And this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, we say it's a test.
You were all connected to the visual.
Now.
There's a city that's sure, you've photographed in every way, and you've asked yourself more than once, but at that smoke, "What's the tombs that are you doing?"
But the bridge of Brooklyn can sound?
The bridge of Brooklyn is an executional.
It's completely online.
And I want to add it to the top.
(Music) (Music)
(Music) (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Music)
(Music)
(Music) (Music) (English) Good afternoon, good morning.
(Music) (Music)
(Making drum-like sounds) (Making drum-like sounds) (Making drum-like sounds) (Laughter)
(Applause) I say to the Counter that is really affecting me on the side and something important to say.
Hello, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because on the other hand of the world.
It's not magical because it's on the other hand.
It's magical because under our eyes every day.
Maybe many of you?
They know a pair of places.
In this picture?
The sound rule is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, going around a city, losing yourself in the same city, well, I knew Genova.
I knew Genova because there were many times, there were absolutely captured many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that, among my favorite cities, now, I've scavenged the applause, I'll tell you this!
To record the first sounds.
And the first sounds were given to these children, which in this tube ...
Difference, an important part, gave me this audio camp.
And I'll make you feel, before the Greek camp, and then, that's worked.
(Music) And now, what's the lab?
(Music)
(Music)
(Music)
That's not it.
Let's go to the aircraft?
(Audience talking) Great.
(Audience) Yes!
And I like a poem, I'm part of the fact that...
I'm not normal, I've never been, I've attacked this beautiful, and it has restricted me a very low frequency that has become a synthesiser.
(Audience) Hi!
They're in the middle.
I'm in the lab.
Of course, Genova is "Mor Zandis" (Laughter) He wasn't killed, this is a serious thing.
Let's give a moment.
The writing.
That you see constantly in the pity of Ferrari, it's not just a writer, for me it's a great musical tool.
And it helped me to support the sound of this colony.
It's more or less like this.
(Music) This is the opposite.
The last sound, after I really want to sound new, is that of...
Look at the doors' boats.
That we are used to look at, but the sound is a perception that is opposed to the view, and so I created this microphone.
"No."
Immersed for 48 hours.
In Genova's port, I found a sound of a track that gave me a particular frequency that became the melody, and when it became the melody, it's because putting it in the loop is transformed into what the brain is.
The voice of the sound colony.
(Sounds) This is its rock.
(Music)
It's true.
Well, now I'd like to make you feel good, but I've come to this point, no.
Here's Genova as a sound.
(Music)
(Music)
(Music)
(Music)
(Music)
One, two, three, four, four, four!
The more you're missing, the more you're going to see.
(Applause)
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
It goes to the sound of our passions, in my and your own.
And for how many people will tell you that they're rumorous, stuck.
For a long time, it's really simple.
I've always just heard it, and I'll bring you to listening, thank you (Applause)
(Applause)
As it's said Guybek in Italian, the word generally used is restitution, it's not perfect, but it has no idea, in generating the idea of restitution linked to monetary restitution.
It has the benefit.
Many times, instead, the restitution is related to restricting what you did, what you learned.
And passing from those who say, doesn't work anything.
Then, in Italy, nothing works in this country, we try it, so the next 18 minutes shared some examples of this story.
Going from the end of the '90s, precisely, this is my son's army.
He has rescued, approached, followed.
In the same year, my monkey organized the funds to pay the material.
From the asylum.
It was an activity.
Very heavy, made with many parents.
But some of them said, "No, why should we help, we must think of the common state?"
Most of them were extraordinary.
To help the asylum to help the community.
It has collected a million 200,000 allies, because I don't remember, I'm 600 euros away.
And it was one of the individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later, we take the United States, this is now...
It's similar: the same similar school for a close school, this is the biggest child.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we realize that it's a totally extraordinary reality.
There's the thing of the gameback, of the restitution.
It's normal.
So the extraordinary effort of an Italian genital is ordinary for all that society.
Not that the American society is perfect.
Therefore.
I said this, the concept of restitution, I've had fortune, I'll replace it.
It helps school.
They help university, they help the museum, the the the the theater, there are all the communities financially.
It's a matter of volunteer.
It's not that there's no volunteer, there's a phenomenon and a positive circle.
There were mechanisms, fiscal lucidity, there are processes.
It works, a society based on this.
I'm ten years old, some of you may have known it, this is the south's launch.
It has supported the famous Obamaker.
Sit that says, "System is the moment."
Tran is trying us a lot.
In fact, it's for sure that the system is given to me at the moment.
Obama lights the famous bank, and there was an incredible technological debate.
Technological advance has been 600 million dollar, so not worried about these things that didn't happen only in Italy.
Do you build a site that doesn't work?
There are so many million contacts, and this is the standard answer they got.
In short, criticizing not finishing for a few days, but then someone stopped criticizing, and it's enough to do it.
Going from criticizing, which is easy and normal to try to do and help, which is difficult, extraordinary.
This is not a common thing.
This is Time Magazine's coverage.
Refigure the experts of technology that were sent by Google and other companies, they were offered.
And I agree with the Bianca house, I didn't have the architect, I put it in the function, the sid, stayed in a few weeks.
It has a decim of costs.
Probably, many would have criticized, but Google, surely, has their own interests between this.
What about it?
The extraordinary effort, and not the ordinary, I've seen that I've finished in TAMEGS, was very interesting, and that's what...
I want to explain what was spinning, I've spinning from people, more still.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this validity, this bag, and they decided to reproduce the experiences.
They had their lives, experiences that ...
In this case?
They look at the ability to manage big technological systems, complex, unbearable processes.
Ripetible.
And make them, at the same time, unbearable and unbearable.
And creating a replicable system, which is the USA, from this effort, then was born.
A system replicates what we hope to do with us.
I want to talk about the word model.
Because one also implies the models, which were the help of our lives that inspired us and taught us.
Those who taught you perseverance, the desire to never move, to continue to insist.
Energy, empathy.
So these models are part of this bag that we need to use, we want to reproduce.
For me, obviously, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also the factor of Italy.
Almost 30 years old from the History.
The idea of helping was also because I'm Italian.
"What?"
I wanted to do it.
Two out of the night, the risk doesn't bring.
To do or not do, there's no attempt, maybe it's in Italian, it's to do or not only to criticize.
A few years later, we are five against San Francisco, and the Visica Avenue to Silicon Valley reins the sensitive need for the transformation in general.
That thing has stopped us a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of processes and digital transformation of the public administration.
He asks me, "Why don't you help us in Italy for a couple of years?"
I think, it reflected us, the pavement with my wife, Monica, and I talk to my genius.
In the short, I decided to apply a choice methodology, so said, "Don't regret," "Don't pent," between a few years, I think I've tried and I haven't managed, or I think I haven't even tried it.
The choice was made, and so it's been sent to the Rome for two years.
It's a matter of...
Hi, Amazon.
But I'll ask you to do Mallia Amazon, a robot, a six-made, but something will give you underwater, these are only many phrases, and I must say that we've also received so much support, so at this moment we're focusing on this part, but there was a positive part.
I was mentally preparing the skeleton and the bureaucracy, people ask me, "But do you expect this little bubble, and yes, I didn't expect it, of course?"
But the scientist must have often cynicism that characterizes you a certain mentality.
You will never do it, of course, because you don't have the rights, I've heard a lot of this kind.
This country, in fact, lacks a lot the sense of common good.
And it's about doing things because you think of helping, to improve a situation not only because it's not interested.
And here's it: for the days of you, this is a commission.
The oldest ones recognize it, as you'll be able to measure, I say this because it's their rule that allowed me to be able to assume people from the public administration.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is.
It's like the systems from inside don't become, right?
We want to try to transform them with people out there, where the fact that they don't know the public administration.
It's an asset.
And not a vanity, it's a advantage and a disadvantage.
So, financially, we created a small team, I wanted a small team to read 25 people a number.
It's not big, but it's also too small: technological experts around 80% are expected to do legal judges, legal.
Governative of communication.
Here you can see the post I had done when, by myself, I started this adventure.
I said, "Why don't we write?
What I think will happen.
In this way, we want to attract talents, talents that you live in Italy, or that you want to come back.
Also temporary, it has a very well-being compensation of what you see.
How do I keep you?
So I put myself in the idea, but how do I convince someone to do the same thing I'm doing?
On the other hand, maybe some of you recognize it, that blank photograph of the bright of the beautiful, that in the '47s all the United States have put the children of the phone, all the United States, in this massive sport.
I've seen investments in infrastructure.
We created the vision.
The operative system of the country, a series of fundamental components that are used to build simpler and effective services for citizens, public administration and companies.
Through innovative digital products.
The very beautiful vision, the implementation, is the blood and blood.
I continued in my place: soccer field in Salita, since the American soccer, if I don't make mistakes.
And I continued, we will also have many rules complicated, sometimes incomprehensible, it's a easy prediction.
We must learn to manage with intelligence and bureaucracy, many will say, "Don't understand how public works in education."
They've already spoken in many, they've failed, in Italy it doesn't work like that.
What's up?
We'll get many criticisms: some comments will be useful, others will be cinemas and prejudices.
The criticisms of the first type will come from people who want to really offer their contribution, and we've found them a lot.
The second type of color they want to defend the state of the school is that they always see the bubble in the middle of the void.
Or that, simplerly, the helplessness is drawn.
And this is a big problem.
To teach things that don't work.
Remember this image: the first, men and women on the cover of Time Magazine.
Here's it.
So, despite looking for the most possible people to do with the eye, I received about three,000 questions.
From that certainly, at least a scientist, we decided to qualify, we used digital tours for ecologists, an app called Jazz, we have it in the middle of the government.
It made me a mathematical test, a third of colors, in the technological part.
The team has reached the mass of CRP, so there are seven people, and now we are a little more living, and it has immediately started to operate, what do we do?
Audience: Oh!
In fact, we take care of Draulica.
These are the tubes of the public administration, some of them to do a lot about connecting, because it's a big problem.
Okay.
The systems, the processes, the applications, anything that should be interconnected.
It's "asylos" and it doesn't connect.
And I'm not only talking about the machine, I'm also talking about people who don't want to explore their own data, their own software, their own applications.
So it's introduced to the thing, to write, to explain it.
And in years, implementing it, interruptability connectivity.
And sponsor the code of the public administration.
Then it rises the software, obviously, and to do so much activity of the project management.
So, so much hydraulic activity.
We can't also be pictures.
To make the services of the beach, in time, you have to make them better, to make them better, to make them easier.
All these things are done in parallel, but without the tubes you can't do the painter.
After a few months, in the midst of 2017 we wrote the piano, "Trienna," the Administration public, we did it together with the ages of other people who helped us.
What's particularly the trendal piano for the digital transformation of the publication?
In other words, there's one thing that exists.
Due?
It's written in a clear way.
Phnological.
But also in the process.
The first time was ...
It has saved and sponsorized from the Government, the Gentilonia Parliament has affected the decrease of the presence of the minister, the digital staff is a priority of the government, the triennal piano.
It requires a team game to simplify public administration, the city of the citizen, particularity of the piano.
Once a year, for those planes, they can't be static, especially in technology.
And the administrations are appreciated.
What is this, this is the only way to do the pieces in Italy, in the public administration?
The regulation remains the technical rules, and you read exactly three pains of view and connections from other norms to another ego, and at some point the technological rules are quite hidden.
Later, we can't abolish these things, but we can do it in parallel.
Other things.
So, the trendal piano.
I put the technology of you to understand it.
It's put on shape, where we can.
To talk to the administrators, to make us give feedback, the documentary on the rhythm of Ox, in a way that the administrators themselves, the technologies to publish administrations, the software and the post.
To improve it.
We dedicate ourselves to this particular moment, and this is always the part of the piano.
There are the militant platforms, these are the digital platforms, they are those things that ability to ignore all the activities of the public administration, the more there will be.
Digital payment is one: electronic card, electronic letter, which is a big platform.
The identity of digitalizing a mobile platform.
The major project we've followed is called a national and resilient population.
"Yes."
Let's put this, technologically, all the data of you, citizens, that at this moment are at 8,000 different silences, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, the only Data-Base.
Where data is talked about them, especially synchronized.
And they talk to the rest of applications of the administration: when I dress from one common to the other.
I have to.
Firstly, what I was managing, manually, then I have to go to the island, the motorization, to all those places, I have to say, all those things I've already had to know.
We're solving the technological solution, then we'll do so much about processes.
Two weeks ago, we made a series Akaton.
where 800 software developers have worked on those brilliant applications, they were used in front of six interventions.
Bagfixing, so, putting problems on software, a improvement of documentary, and even new projects.
It was made in 25 Italian cities.
I also think that it's not Italian, but there are many Italians who are helping us from the technological point of view, out of the History.
All of this?
It's built.
We're talking about sustainability and scalability in the sight of true perspective, like T, where they're exposed, all the documentary, and all the codes, but at least always more, apps.
In the Italian publication, now there will be a fifth of what would be left, maybe even less.
The future is today, we dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that, financially.
They don't limit themselves to do hydraulic, they also enter the boat.
But it serves that the paintings are completed, sorry, I insist, this can be, for example.
And it's one of those things I'd like to do.
Although we'll leave the alsa aviation, we're digital citizenship.
"Oh, the phone!"
Smartphone.
I have the digital identity, I've given the electronic identity, INPR.
It's already functional.
And all this, the goal is to make it easier, to improve the interaction between the citizens and the public administration.
The interface is simple.
We're dreaming a little, because of work we'll really do so much, but it's different from this vision.
A few weeks ago, the storm.
It's been around 150 years since the world has written an uncertainty.
They expect us many people to ask us.
To talk about what they think can happen, I was asked to talk about simplification of the lives of every day of the citizens.
I've taken the opportunity to write an article that I want to mention to you.
Some fish?
It's a desire or dream, maybe we do it.
We want a country where politicians who try to understand the digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rule and not the exception.
A country where they read recognize and promote the right to innovate, to embrace it.
A country wants technological skills that are also inside the state and public companies.
A country where there are more public companies and private, guided by 30 years than 70 years.
Imagine, in the end, a country where working for public administration is a northern, where better brains make people work in public research centers, which are green and their centers of excellence and innovation.
They take development to the country.
That's why it's a dream.
And that the components to do all this, the politicians of the process?
Technological digitals are really many and maybe too many.
But if you don't have a dream about which points are difficult, you can do some things.
First to conclude.
This is my mom who belonged to the people who told me, "Who did you do it?"
(Audience) Yes!
And here it serves somewhere in this theater, among the other.
But at this point, it's more calm, and I couldn't explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the digital Tinet, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want us.
Stop.
(Laughter)
Audience: Yes!
Wow!
(Alarm) (Audience) Hi!
And if you want information about us?
Our site and our social media (Applause)
(Music) (Music)
Did you know the possibility to make a desire?
Just to change a aspect of your life?
That doesn't go like you're going.
What would you change?
What would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your genius, your employees?
You're afraid, you're looking at it, it's for that, huh?
"Because what's the title, the sound you had?"
So raise your hand those who would change their own body, maybe lose some kilos.
Or maybe win them in muscles?
Ah, well, here there's a little more, there's more freedom.
Please raise your hand those who would change countless, the best ones to understand.
Of this, I was sure I would have traveled everyone.
Maybe you're the ones who would change part of it.
(Audience) Yes!
More times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
Let's not understand if you'll change the part.
And the answer varied, because the elementary ones would have had a more united family.
My parents were separated.
In the media, I would have wanted to be beautiful.
For the pleasure of the youths.
At Liceo, I wanted to feel the most complicated teachers, they seemed to me all the hostiles.
And I was reflected in music here.
The great voices to make in the living room.
I saw the university, I wanted to work, but I met the difficulty of access to the job market.
So, all the first part of my life I had to fight and fight to try to understand how to change the things that didn't work well.
What the others thought about me?
To the great economical fears, from interpersonal relationships.
To my characteristics, acquired until the birth.
When did I become a psychologist?
Instead, I looked at my research to other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
These strategies, if you use them in a small dose, could also bring some benefit, but as most cases happen.
They were the only three maps to play in front of a crisis.
Not only did they solve a good nulla, but they ended up maintaining their problems in life.
The strategy, today, is more diffused.
Is it?
To wake up.
But we forget it a little bit of everything.
There's crisis, there's no work, there's traffic, it's cold, that I'd have done in a different way.
We eat it because there's no justice.
I know many people who fit in the bottle of the window.
And the problem is that if it's mental space, this paralyzes you.
It's hypnotized and it's aligned.
The spots of eye.
I remember a girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything else than when I started talking to when I stopped going home.
He started lamenting the ex-fidanced, who left it, then from the girl with whom he had translated it.
So the fact that I didn't have work, the last work of the government that hadn't helped it, felt like a value, a capacity, and now that it was the mind.
She was completely colonized all her daily life.
In other words, unfortunately.
It's a bit the great attempt.
Because with a small effort.
I want to get a great result.
To review the rule of the victim.
It was listened, comfortable, helped.
But look well.
Can you lament the night or day?
Only or with friends.
Ad alta voice?
Or in your mind.
Can you lament something already happened, or something that could happen maybe a tomorrow?
You can lament yourself at the roof, or as much more often happens, you can lament yourself in the right.
Because we all have many reasons to be able to lament.
But the truth is that for how much you will make you hardly remember something around you.
It will change, elderly, you won't give more attention to what makes you say.
If the strategy that privileges, when things don't go as you would like, is to slow down.
Do you think someone is in the study of a B piano?
This is to save the branches.
It invites the magnifying glass.
Another very objective strategy, when things are stretched, is to impose us.
To impose our need.
(Laughter) At the base of this mentality, there's a growing cultural fact that we learned that if something doesn't work well.
It's enough to change it, we can manipulate our pleasure.
What surrounds us.
Don't you like the shadow?
But from aesthetic circle.
(Laughter) You feel a little further, but why never be in suffering?
We take two pillars and we solve it easy.
Are you ready?
For divorce.
At fresh, we all agree how many risks to the palm.
Children don't listen to you, read it.
It's too big not to register it, to send it to the psychologist, we're here for this, on the other hand.
My vocation, the choice is for this, that profession.
To make the world around you get involved in the perfection.
What are your essences?
But the context inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way is.
The relationships of coppy.
I remember one, a copy.
Well, during the collapse of which I didn't do anything else than listening to what, according to one, the other would have to change to solve.
The lucks of their future.
Hey.
Yes, but of course you're to agree, but not even to prepare yourself in the Chinese.
It's still there.
And she, right?
If you don't try to be for that.
And he doesn't.
You don't realize all the things I do for you.
And she, "No, if you don't listen to me, otherwise you'll do another well to meet me, and so you'll see the infinite arm of a lovely iron."
That always starts with the same word, stretched.
And because we have to show all the water line of the other, we have to make them see all the problems that should be cured to reproduce our happiness that has kidnapped us.
(Laughter)
But the truth is that if this thing is often in good ugly, believing us deeply.
We can hardly change something, elderly.
Instead of choosing the node at the base of the relationship, we end up choosing them to heal them.
It's the strategy that privileges.
When things don't go as you want, the one to impose your need and wait for others to modify themselves as a consequence.
I think about a couple of times, because I'll have a life ...
It has resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, is it?
To make us feel that there is no structure to take the head and put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, there's often the fear of facing the conflict that would emerge.
So we had to show our needs.
So what do we do, do we suffer them for the common good?
But in this way, we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity.
And we live in the market, we need others.
AC: I remember a young boy, a young boy, a son of separated parents, who, at the end of the first childhood, had learned to distress with great diplomacy between the children of mom and dad.
I hope I hope that when you were openly drawn in the face of one, you would have lost the love of the other.
In this limited situation.
I learned important things, for example, I learned.
To listen.
To accept, to think about motivations among them, even distant from one from the other, but on the other hand, I'll never learn to say no.
The things they didn't go well, they didn't learn.
To say no to the relationships they were going to look for it, there was any relationship condition, and elderly, it was one of those who always had to measure it, but in this way.
They were going to finish their needs, their wishes, their ambitions, they were always underwater to fear of facing the conference.
It's the need to contain all of us.
It's the strategy that privileges, when things don't go as they want.
Is it to suffer your needs?
First, your body will start to talk to you, and instead of all of you.
I'll end up uncontenting them.
It's not just about lamenting.
In addition to their needs, or to suffocate them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say, with the means of cause, because I myself, throughout my life, has abused.
I'll tell you what happened to me.
One day, the first hospital in which I was collaborating sent me to call and said to me.
I make mistakes here, for her, there's no more place.
If you like to continue the collaboration with us, you have to accept a transfer.
And he told me a far away place, lost, detesitated from the most, or if everything would be there to make a job that didn't even enter a big deal with everything I had studied until then.
I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to lament myself.
Trying to make them change the idea, the doctor, but sending that other.
And even less because I've never had to accept a commitment.
That for me it was unbearable.
There you go.
But having different results would have had to do different things.
For the first time, of course, on my legs, at that moment.
Do you understand that the secret?
To change others?
It's changing yourself.
If it was changed me?
The others would also be able to follow, modify, change.
If it was a super brilliant, complete, unique psychologist, the first one wouldn't send me to travel.
If I had also done it, the thing wouldn't have touched me more than so, old, maybe I would have been there before I was the only kiss.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
The answer didn't go to the other's fault, but I had to introduce myself to the profound of my own.
Responsability.
Why things?
They don't change.
We are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do?
It's in the direction of choosing us.
You choose you.
How does things cause?
That they don't go like you're going.
You choose yourself as a cause of things that are not like you.
This is our bias.
If I never find the work of the crisis, you're putting the only arms to your disposal.
Now we'll find ourselves alone, in the hands, to face something too much bigger, I want to say, "It's the crisis's fault, what do you want to do?"
But if you're part of the Earth, and you think you're perfect, that maybe you have a change margin.
And then improve yourself, then you open your doors in front of you, because it becomes your responsibility, it makes you decide to learn a new language.
To read books, to attend new skills, to consolidate those who already have.
You can work on you to become unique.
Because life is those who do it.
Who doesn't do it?
He suffers it.
If inside the copy, things don't go well, you think it's the other to do the first step.
It's sending you a message of inequality, and you're going away.
If you're part of you.
And maybe your own contributions, every day, this simple question.
What can I do today differently?
To make your best day.
So, things?
They change.
But they don't change, but they change because you're you who're changed.
Before going to the research of his lacks.
Now she's looking for her needs.
And then we try to operate.
To be able to satisfy them.
And in this way, I create a mental space inside which we can take care of one another instead of making the war.
I don't know if you want to do it.
You're one of those people.
They are with everyone who must always say, "Yes, one of those people I call, forgive me in the end, prostitute and relational."
It's clear that you're not only losing time, but you also lose the sense of meaning, the things you do.
If you start with yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand which actions you put in the field to preserve them.
So the game becomes something inside which you can become the pattern of the table.
And starting to work on me, considering myself a cause of the things that didn't go as I wanted, instead of their simple effect.
I also started to have a better person.
When I was writing to the university, I had a dream.
The dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to make them understand that with my matter.
There were practical tools, concrete, sometimes fast.
To bring great value inside their lives.
But friends, I met with a couple of...
The problems?
Stereotypes, prejudices, psychologist is the doctor of the matters, the psychologist is the doctor of the debts, but he had to talk to a friend, but he goes to the park.
What would I have to do?
Would I have to lament myself or possible that you don't tell you how beautiful psychology is?
I had to try to change their mental priority, I had to drop my dream.
No, I had to.
To learn to talk about a language, which was what didn't happen, as the agent closer, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way.
I had to learn to listen to their needs.
But what?
I missed mine.
Is it a turning point?
Little time, following this direction, I got results for me.
Inimaginable.
When I finished my primary school and his transfer proposal, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights.
What can we do?
I thought about it, and finally I decided.
I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as he understood him.
I'm transferred here.
I went home, I killed the computer, and I registered a video I carried on YouTube.
In which I spoke about psychology, here for the chronologist, I say I'll take a few launch.
Maybe you think it's OK.
In the turn of a little time, my YouTube channel is a reference point in Italy, for what psychologists look at in the video, thanks to this thing every day thousands of people.
And they approach psychology by discussing some of the stereotypes I mentioned before.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm in 79: I share psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best schools, in Italy, leaves my review.
And what touched me more than everything.
It was the recognition that the colleagues, at the beginning, have wanted...
I had to let myself down.
Because, obviously, they saw that my attempt to innovate the profession in a way to communicate it had something sense, and in Lombardia I was read to the vice-president.
What a dream come true?
They don't become reality, why?
For example, fortunately, or because you've had that.
The theory that must have is the one that keeps moving forward, who doesn't know how it is built and needs to distrugle you.
You have to do it.
And also so much to discuss your identity, your points of belonging to your certainties, your habits of always.
If there's something I learned from all this inner journey.
It's that the most important transition.
Maybe the most delicate, but also the most urgent.
It must come to our internal world.
Ten minutes ago I asked you a question.
Thank you very much.
If I had the chance to express a desire, one only to modify a aspect of your life that doesn't go as a forest.
What would you change, have we talked about work, physical perspective, the current contact?
Well, in fact, I'd like to leave you with a gift, or at least try it.
It's a small question that was personally very useful to me.
And that's based on logic that, to get to produce big changes, we have to focus on many small actions.
What's the smallest thing?
And easier.
What could you do until now, at the end of the afternoon, to return home after this beautiful day, and that will allow you to take the first step?
To put.
Your life in the direction?
Here you're auspicious.
You can think, what is the smallest, the simplest thing you can do to put your life in the direction?
That's where you live.
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
(Applause)
(Music)
AD.
"I have your keys of the fridge, I have to eat."
Or, ugly, leave the pull, right?
Do you see, but where do you put the bags?
The mathematicians are the prove.
Obviously, now I call you.
I'm happy that it's time to change.
"My son is when my mother arrives."
Do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to talk for eight minutes.
And me, this?
I want to take this time by myself.
I had a dream.
To create an integration band.
Diversity and diversity.
The percussions are so fast.
So you can see.
They take the distances and unite the battles.
Are we part of it?
We're lost in seven.
Seven kids.
I see them, I see Laura, Paola.
Daniela.
I saw them grow.
Our tests were the marketing.
The sea was the day of evidence.
Where was this talk entered?
It's enough in the school of Andreoli music.
We took the first bidons.
It was together.
The first waves together.
Then we decided to become a good mark.
From there, we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical brands and travels: the first businesses, the first brands in good pieces.
The first satisfaction, the first...
Uncontrol.
The first satisfaction?
For the kids, for us, for everything we were doing.
But above all, the first applause.
Unfortunately...
One night of the 20th of 2012, the world fell down.
And the real sense of the word.
In other words, the cases were completely unbearable or crowned: a strong earthquake scope made our earths.
And from that moment on, we were ...
The earthquakes of the thousands.
For all the inequalities, we were called this.
As I said, the houses were...
Not more agible.
Many crowns: our proof, our place where it is.
Where there were all the Martians, it was completely district.
And the tools were inside.
What did we do?
I, the Sahara, Marco, Fed, Matteo.
We've all tried them.
In the bottles, and the roads.
Are we able?
Luckily, we found them all.
We've finished all of us inside a tender, in a tender, in the seventh of Middle Ages.
In that tenderness?
There are magnificent things.
We've seen fear sounding stronger.
Because the flag of the sound is stronger than the earthquake.
He looked at us in the eyes.
The Earth that was shaking?
To look for...
A smile.
A look.
It's the Earth shaking.
Right there.
We built the first tools.
The scary cests.
They became houses in the bank.
From the tubes that have become...
That the tools built and suited with ping pong racks.
To get rid of it with big houses.
Cross.
We were in the continuous way.
In continuous work, always, there was an amazing energy.
Although we were at a terrible moment.
The inside was born our first protocol.
We decided to put on a real sponsor.
However, the group's components were increasing, the friends spent the word.
From 20 to 20 we were, we became 25 to 40.
50?
We are part of the construction of the first protocol: the white.
Because there were the smallest loops, the biggest loops and the white genius.
At that moment, we all moved together.
Like a blank of lights.
Then, immediately after?
Have we done it?
Last year, we did the other sponsorship, the surgery.
We became all marine.
Because we really wanted to navigate.
And to move a moment of our Earth.
To breathe for a moment.
That year later we made a crack, this marine monster, immediately afterwards.
50 speakers, this flywheel?
And to conclude, that of this year, the sea of the Moon.
The sea is from the Moon.
We wanted to close a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There are many things inside this tenderness.
And none of us would never have thought that it's a tender?
It could change our lives.
But what?
We did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
What are the minutes finishing?
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems to me a favola.
150 concerts spinning in Italy.
The first magician's stage?
The concert in the TV program at home.
And the mother's stage?
And we really did many.
And also to me, being forbidden, because this is exactly me.
It's exactly the scenery of life.
The fatigue of the sweat, but also.
From the freshness.
That it's so much possibility to the future.
That's it.
What happens when a dream ...
It becomes reality.
Now I have to come back from the flows, do you expect me?
Is there still so much?
To build.
Thank you all (Applause)
(Applause)
(Background music)
Audience: Yes!
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) One, two, three.
(Applause) One, two, three.
Radini.
There's no doubt.
250, very important.
They changed our history radically.
And that we live today.
Do we talk about social innovation?
And my question is: What is this innovation?
And above all, our Italy, which is often so biased.
It's a ready country.
To incorporate these digital innovations and to be tested at the same time of innovation.
We put it to digital photos, we all carry it.
As a result, close to us, an object, I believe almost everyone.
In fact, in the body, an evolution that was extraordinary and has crossed these 250 years.
The phone, right?
The phone is a technological solution that belongs to the industrial revolution.
It's an evolutionary computer.
And the computer belongs to them.
The revolution is the Internet, it's connected, and once again, this is an invention of the Internet revolution, of the Internet, of our history.
Nevertheless.
These three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new time.
And we have, in some way, strictly battled in the 2000s, that we're living today.
So let's try to understand what happened in these three...
In these 250 years, what do they summarize?
The industrial revolution, the revolution and the Internet, and the Internet.
The Industrial Revolution, when we look at it, we probably remember it as a Ferrovia.
It's what we've studied.
I didn't have any money at school.
Actually, it wasn't just a Ferrovia.
We, at the industrial revolution, are enormously debated.
It's enormous debates, for example, because we need the vapor motorcycle.
The vapor motor isn't just a vapor motorcycle, but it's, for example, that tool.
And it has favored, and it has resulted much faster, the stages of carbon.
And the possible reaction is a significant cost.
And then the vapor motorcycle has entered the corners, it has entered the founders, and it has started to change the modality, but it doesn't make sense.
We don't only have the motorcycle.
To vapor, we also need them.
The driving force.
It's a scope motorcycle, because, on the other hand, it's an Italian invention.
The motorcycle has scored.
I don't know.
For example, we need the automobilistic industry.
In fact, before the Christmas industry, because the motorcycle was a motorcycle that couldn't leave the farm, when they were able to understand.
It was a driving force in the end, when they couldn't understand how to get out of the bottle, to make it even true, and it became that scent that has developed.
The automobilistic industry is everything that has come to us.
But I'm not.
In the industrial revolution, we are still debates, for example, for the phone.
The phone isn't just that tool that has allowed us.
To avoid continuing to see our letters and that had velocidaded the migration of these letters from one part to the other of the world, always more than we knew.
But it's also what has allowed us, and it has taught us.
The deposit of the caves?
It's under the sea.
And yes, because then on the phone we could try them in the sea.
And then, what did we do?
We interrupted everything.
We went forward, standing on the sea.
The first cavity, to give you a storal dimension, was taken from Italy between medicine and the opening.
Not just two populations wake up of agreement, but the first cavity went there.
And we are around 1858.
I have the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know what it is, we use it, brings it to our voice, in 187900 subscribed to Rome.
It's only 1877.
Another intention is electric energy, the first electric power.
The continental, in Europe, was built by Santa Radagonda, where there is the Milan Renaissance.
Today, it's the scent: there, a time in 1873 is used the first electric center.
In that year, on December 30th, the scale was lit.
A part of our history was born exactly from there.
Let's move forward, we try to make a little longer, and we get to 1950 of Italy, already grown, and it's getting to know a certain agency, for another, it was a century.
It's still in the course, but it has already lived important staffs and also important emotions from a point of view.
It begins to be born something, to compose something that has never been in a story before.
They are the computer, they are calculators.
Researchers who, at the beginning of the '50s, could be in a stadium like this, and had functions of my body.
They simply made the calculation faster.
But they went forward and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors, they started to be the artificial intelligences we know.
But in these 50 years of the Internet revolution, something else happened.
There were research institutions, and above all, there were scopes.
From tubes, from defense, who brought to develop subterraneous reactions, but not underground because they took on the ground, but underground because they were not known.
At some point, we decided to open these laws.
And these challenges, called ARPA, ARPANET, the network.
They became and started to be the website we know.
A diffused, or horizontal system, not hierarchical, extremely captured, capable of bringing information, of gathering information, of generating information.
To give you an idea, in 1981 there were only 300 the computer connected to the Internet.
In 1995, there were 25 million.
Not many.
Today, it's in the order of thousands, because we're not talking about the computers we use, but of all these intelligent systems that connect to the network.
To care about data, to pick up data, or to work for data.
But when is the mechanical strength?
It was made of replacement.
It was introduced by the industrial revolution.
It started to include the artificial intelligence of computers.
And mobility?
"Yes."
The Internet had the time we started to live the era we've lived now.
What are we living now?
The one that is called on the Internet, and this, according to a phenomenon of creation and destruction.
It's financially an industrial process that tells us that what is new progressively disturbs what is old because it needs space.
And we'll see better then how.
But this is the story of the great numbers, of the great inventions.
But there's a story that is a little more human, that belongs to us a little more, on which I try to make a reflection.
I'm trying to accompany you.
When, little by little, the Italy hasn't made the Italian, it was 1863.
The Minister Minghetti put you in English finances.
It establishes that the 27th of the Middle Ages is corresponded to the payment and public dependents.
And from 27 to the next months, what happened?
In this moment, even if we don't realize it, we're introducing my strangers, something extraordinary.
First, the richer of a family, more than a single one.
He was in his ability to produce good services that were necessary to his own support.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky of the stages, less risky of the elevation.
It started somehow to move away from the Earth.
And above all...
It has transformed the economic power to produce products.
In goods and services, in the production of one.
Well, the dwell.
But there's a second aspect.
And what is the safety?
For us women, obviously, it was a revolution that has enough to read.
But what was the fridge in fact?
It's that it's not only the object that frees us from the audience to go and do the spirit every day.
It's also an industrial system that allows us to preserve.
In a massive way, a structured way in a healthy way.
In quantity of food?
So, one day?
City and possibility, once again.
To focus on something that is not...
Immediately, the use of everyday life.
This is the man who begins.
To live to the end of November, these are us.
At the time, how did we say it?
I arrived at the computer and arrived on the Internet, and then there's a figure that has characterized these years, that is an element.
That we can define as the qualifier of these years: speed.
We, 250 years ago, were not fast as we are today.
We, today, do things very fast, move fast and speed.
The speed of the challenges, the speed of the movements, the speed of our movement.
And also the speed of our thinking that is not said the quality of thinking.
But we are very fast.
Even when something happened.
Typically, it's close when you look at the story, to understand the passengers from one second to the other, and sharing data.
That they are not necessarily zero.
1900, 1900 and 2000.
But when can we say that the 20th century is finished?
I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two data that significantly means.
They teach the passage from an early age, from a 21st century, 2001 and 2008.
He gave the waves, "Why?"
First of all.
The American economy started to slow down.
And on the other hand, there were Torri Gemelli, and so something in the equilibrium started to change, these balances that seemed solid, we realized that they were very fragile.
But we went forward until there was something that has slowed all the time: the biggest economic crisis that the Western world, the oriental world together, had never met.
There's no only America to have slow down, almost closed.
There was also the audience.
There were Europeans who were to fail.
The Greek was already the leaves of failure, they don't talk to us, but it's still there.
And it changed something.
But what has changed, the economic paradigm has changed, we couldn't.
Don't wait for the biggest economic crisis.
In fact, if you verified in 2008 it was crazy not to think about it.
But how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension?
When can we do everything?
With many less people.
It was obvious that it would be dead.
We were stuck and we didn't know.
Look at these companies.
This companies ...
They are stable multinationalities, in their majority, but above all, they are all companies that are Dante after 2011.
What did these companies do not innovate?
inventing something, they haven't innovated building something that wasn't there before, but they started to do what we've always done.
To buy, sell, travel, learn.
To make.
He sends differently.
In a more efficient way.
And it's Italy?
It's so often denied.
Let's look at the state of absolute and digital Italy, according to five factors, connectivity.
We are ten percentual points under the media.
Ironistly.
We're almost close to a fast connection for 50%.
It's so much, it's little.
Anyway, something, according to human skills of human resources, competences of curving it, of a different being, between advanced skills and basic skills, with what allow us to flow.
The informatic systems of digital systems.
The advances, those that allow us to develop them.
A third fact that we have to look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it.
A third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of the digital factors in the productive processes.
So, they start.
Or industrialization of products and services.
The fifth is digitalization.
The system of public administration: we immediately need the field of some ambiguity and we keep the first two that are important.
In other words, a good news for everyone: all the five elements are increased.
These five elements that are in a growth, in a growth speed completely inactive until two years ago.
We are lineating European countries, and this is a good news.
On the other hand, with activity, we said it in ten points outside.
But do you really need to look at the newspapers?
We're growing fast.
A very important competitive, the use of the Internet, we are really seconds to a few.
In fact, it was born a very profound change that is aligning us to the European standards.
There are two factors that we must look at with great attention that will be key for our future of countries.
They are the skills and the inclusion of the digital in brutal factors.
In this way, we have to pay a lot of attention to the characteristics of our country.
We have two engines.
The first driver?
It's what made the Italy in the '50s, it's the small businesses.
Long from being, the little media.
Something not useful, not effective.
Not paragonable, in fact, to large multinationals.
I'm probably the most effective entrepreneurial tool to interceive the speed of change: they're agile, they're fast, they're small.
They know how to do something extraordinary that "Made in Italy" has an excellence in the production of service in the production of products.
It's pretty unique in the DNA, we all want it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, competences inside these realities.
Because these realities can become those multinationalities that speak Financial Times.
In other words, those multinationals that can help.
A whole segment.
The market, in an extraordinary way, generating richerness for the whole tissue.
And this is the first asse we have, the first big motorcycle, the second motorcycle that is in Italy.
And its cultural artistic heritage.
A heritage that, for her existential nature, thanks to God, is an analog heritage that will get an analog heritage: we can't digitalize the crop.
But is it possible?
Because tourists don't only visit three cities.
Venezuela, Rome, and then they repeat.
But the richer of these three cities don't do it.
The richness of our country.
And we're learning, maybe we've tried to start, but we're fast to recover.
To include.
This heritage.
In a knowledge system that allows us to carry it and make it notice, and to bring tourism not only to visit three centers, but to visit all our country.
I believe that this is the greatest urge we can.
It's the same for our Italy.
(Applause)
(Music)
(Laughter) The topic I'm talking about in a certain sense is...
The opposite action of the word "while."
What to unify?
That's it.
Our encounter is the opposite of the word "share," because I'll talk not about sharing, but in a certain sense of the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'll talk about inequality, and I'd like to start first.
With a question.
But if someone asked you?
In Brussia Pelo.
Secondly, in the last ones.
15, 20 years old.
We say, in the 21st century.
The inequalities in the world, the inequalities of law between the citizens of the world are increased or decreased.
But I believe most of you will answer.
I'm increased, if you were journalists, maybe you'll reach...
The goal is to preserve it.
I'm increased exponentially.
That's me.
I asked you, "But is it in Italy?"
Maybe the answer of many would be.
And also.
I asked myself these questions in the last few years, and with the only 24th and the foundation of video.
I was prepared with my friends, a report.
In inequalities, from when they are data, that is, financially, from 1960.
For the biggest majority of the countries in the world.
The result is what you see.
This is the curve of the disguised inequality between the citizens of the world, as you can see, there was indeed an increase of inequalities, especially in the 80s, but from now on.
From the end of the last century, in the end of the 90s.
The compessive inequality between the citizens in the world is crowned and precipitated, now we're at the least storage.
And in Italy?
In Italy, as a result, inequality is quite complicated, even here we have an increase throughout the 80s, but in the last 20 years.
(Laughter) We have a growing inequality trend.
How can we read these data?
Well, a possible reading is to say, "We've traveled a collective bathroom because we've continued to talk about years of the increase of inequality, how much does it seem?
Data doesn't support our feeling.
And there's really, surely in this reading, but we could also ask ourselves another question: What if the feeling of an increase of inequality?
That many of us, the same.
Let's do it!
(Audience) Yes!
It wasn't wrong with the feeling.
But maybe it was wrong the idea of inequality in which ...
We think about it.
Perhaps?
We must think about the issue of inequality, about what we understand.
For inequality.
Maybe the concept of inequality?
It requires some rethink.
Have you changed?
It's temporary suspicious this question.
And let's move around a century.
And also the place: let's move.
It's immersed in 1928.
A year before the great Church of the 29th, there Keynes.
It was Cambridge, there was a discourse in front of you.
It has a student audience, a famous discourse, with the economic title for our grandchildren.
In that occasion, Keynes forms two professions.
The first says.
It's a century, productivity.
From an hour to work.
Is it?
Other times the one of today is 1928.
And this trade, in fact, is made because if you went to take it.
The reconstructions of the stories of the economy.
Effectively, in most advanced society, we have an increase of productivity in the turn of 100 years, which is also about...
Ten, twice times, in some case, 15 times, so this teacher was fulfilled, but from this Keynes teacher was also rich.
A consequence, an idea, that is, humanity.
Little by little.
In other words, for a few years, it would be found with a huge amount.
The free time that would have it to...
To work less?
And he also said, to work everyone, and when he said, at least, he understood a lot less, he understood.
A week of 15 hours of work?
Or a horse?
From three hours of work a day.
And he saw a problem for this, because the question that was asked Keynes, but with all this free time we knew how to use it well or not.
Well, that's it.
Apparently, this second orphysics hasn't been done.
Because we all see it, that we don't all work, and it doesn't seem exactly what we work three hours a day.
"Yes, but...
I'll show you that this teacher is divided in two parts, there's one that says we'll all work, it's certainly false.
But the first part ...
We'll work much less, we'll work three hours a day.
Are we sure it's not?
It's made by no part, we're going to see what happened in Italy.
That's it.
This curve, this trajectory, represents the fraction of time.
It's an Italian: medium?
It dedicates the work in the course of your life.
Your life, naturally, is potentially working, that is, from the age of 15.
It's love.
In order to compare a job, well, if we look at this trajectory.
The professor of Keynes, in fact, was done.
Because we were at the beginning of 900, almost 40% of our lives' time.
To work?
And now?
We call it around 16% and the interesting thing is that this 16% ...
Wow!
Two hours and a room a day, that is, the barrier of the three hours in Italy we've already screwed it.
Naturally.
If this happened, there are also reasons.
Obviously, and if you want, banality.
For example, the old age is enormously aligned.
Because we die a lot later, the life expectancy.
It's the one who decides something like 27 years old.
From the beginning of the last century, from 900.
There's another very positive reason, and other banks, if you want.
Our children often study, study long.
Studies, even at 25 and 30 years old, so even young age has been aligned.
But there's a reason, perhaps more fundamental, for which ...
Our quote of time?
I was dedicated to work and crossed.
And it's!
The crop of the occupation rate, that is, the number of people.
What job?
This is the historical series of total occupation.
It's built for this occasion.
And this series is dramatic, because it makes you see.
At the beginning of the century, in all monarchical era.
First of the Second World War, the taste of occupation was even right.
It's often higher than 70%.
Today.
We're very low, we're around 50% scarce, elderly.
From 1968 and 81 years old.
The occupation rate has always been inferior to 50%.
But is it a step of occupation?
In fact, 50 percent.
What does it mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, who don't work, that is, pure consumers who don't perceive any network.
I'm more.
Well, the workers.
In front of this?
In fact.
It's storal.
We can also have a reaction.
It's enthusiastic and say, "But what is this?
The progress, beauty.
It's modernity.
Things went like this because we can allow it.
But then let's see if, in the country that the problem of modernity, that is in the United States, things went in the same way, because if this interpretation is fair, it should have also happened in the United States.
So, let's see the confrontation.
Let's go.
Italy.
It was a moment.
This is the storal series of time.
It's dedicated to work in life, as you can see, and the United States only warms.
Until the 30s, then we established, and there's a reading tendency to the increase while we do it.
But even more impressive, it's the storal series of the occupation rate.
Because here we see.
What's the right?
There's an increase: that small one you see below is the crisis of the 29th.
But after the crisis of the 29th, we have a general tendency of the occupation rate in the United States.
At the increase, instead, in our case, we have it.
What's the feeling?
The reduction.
The taste of occupation.
But then, this ...
In Italy, it's a pathology.
It's not normal.
Why? Because we don't know
They are more people who consume without producing than the people who produce.
Isn't it normal that most of the population ...
I lived in a condition that I'll define.
I said.
"Dipendency parassitary," "dependence," because it depends on the network of your Wisia.
This tube can also be a family, the State.
But why do I consume it?
I have the right to available without working.
I have a friend who does it?
The theater act.
When did I find these results?
We were in the scene and I asked them.
How would you represent this situation with an image, a situation of parasitary dependence?
And he knew what he answered to me.
With the hypothesis and that lights.
It lives on the sphere of the hypothesis, but it's called buffagon, some say buffaga, here it is.
If you want to have an idea of how you behave.
The bubble or the bubble on the prototype, or on the other big mammals, and these fish also live on the broken rivers, on the bubbles, well, we have this thread.
It will treat us for a few seconds, in which you can see.
"Yes."
These fish, these birds.
How do they live?
Speaking of the resources.
Okay.
The bubble provides it, which are insects.
The tree means that everything that albergues on the bubble's face is not clear.
If the bubble is happy or not, that eye that mistakes can mean that it's playing.
It's a path that's invested by the lights.
Anyway it is.
This is what happens in nature, but I'm not an ethology.
So the sociologist, the question I asked myself as a sociologist.
It's another: How can we define a situation of this kind, how do we define a society where there's a majority of pure consumers?
It's a minority.
The producers.
How do we define a society in which?
There's this kind of productive consumption, the first one I said to myself, "But this is the ignorant society?"
Society, gentlemen, like the feudal society, in which there's a ceiling.
What has put in the condition?
To live without working.
But naturally it's not enough: you have to add a qualification.
This is indeed a condition.
What could be defined?
Special society, ladies and gentlemen, mass.
Audience: Yes!
Because consumers are more producers.
In society, it's simple, classic: we have the gentleman and the jungle serves that produce for him.
In the society.
And here the report is clear: it's a relationship of commanding and subtomission, in the ignorant society of Mars.
These things are a little more complicated: gentlemen, many became.
"Yeah!"
The relationship between signals and producers is much more complicated.
Greek Dubezon, a great psychologist and psychologist, would have defined it a relationship of Open Legame, we see why.
The relationship?
From bubble with the hypothesis, and from parasitism, and this is a advantage signed in green, but it's also dependence, because it depends on food that is there.
It's on the sphere of the hypothesis.
The red light indicates one.
It's a disadvantage.
And also from the point of view of the producers, we have, again, a red fresh, a green fresh, the autonomous hypothesis doesn't need the bubble.
But it's somehow in an obligation report, how are we?
The colors we maintain.
Because we can't, we can't use the fish that live.
On their spices.
So the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of legacy, but a situation ...
That's not fine.
Is it a situation?
In which?
That's it!
A new problem of inequality, and now we get there.
The question I had asked about Keynes, today, perhaps, is the real inequality?
And inequality of access to work.
Access to work is very asimeteric in our social system, but if inequality is.
And access to work we can use the tools.
It's the analysis of inequality, that is to calculate an efficient concentration of genius, which is the tool with which...
It's measured by inequality, we can apply it to work: there are people who don't work, who have a job, who have two jobs.
And the position of the History, in this scale of inequality of access to work, is dramatic.
There is a series.
And there's the last one in the graduation together.
She's Turkey?
The country in which inequality reaches the maximum, but simply because there's the exclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, we would probably have the palm of this creator, the best situation, the one of Norway.
With the United States, I was in the middle.
They need us to become an Oxis country, normal, seven million jobs.
How did we get to this, this is the story?
The disadvantage of access to work in Italy is always measured in any kind of genius, you can see something clamorous, that inequality is minimal during monarchical age, especially under the faster.
And it's massive in the public age, especially under the second publication.
It's the one we live in.
They lack us seven million jobs, if we had seven million jobs in more, our families.
They would perceive it.
1,000 euro a month, in more, we would have 12,000 euros of round, in more.
At the year.
And our state would have 150 billion euros to spend as much as they cost the health and the school put together, more or less in Italy.
That's it.
And here I conclude.
But one.
Nights.
We have the scholarship to write, in the first article of the Constitution, the History is a democratic Republic based on work.
We are the only country.
It has this in the first title of the Constitution, and we are the worst country together with Turkey.
The West.
That's why.
We change things.
And we believe it.
The seven million places of work that lack.
Or maybe it's better to cancel the article one of the Constitution.
Because, being so, things sound like a bubble.
Thank you (Applause)
