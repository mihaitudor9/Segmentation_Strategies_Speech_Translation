Did you find it?
Power and fragility.
Someone of you will ask what these two words have to do so far.
Well, you have to know that until a while ago, my two largest children, Mars and Francesca, and to sleep, they chose two words, and I had to tell you a story about those two words.
Now, this thing doesn't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So the story I'd like to tell you this afternoon.
So, the story begins with the child's loneliness: the words were made to go out, just stayed blocked in his mouth.
Anyway, the years pass, the child becomes a young man, but he suffers a lot about this problem of bubbles, it's so much that he proves to find psychologists, all the great people, great professionals, but no one can choose this uncertainty.
One day, he does a trip to Rome, and so, fortunately, he finds a candle.
And this old man says to the young man, "I don't have fear," so much that everyone around me said Madre Teresa, but that beautiful words of freedom of calculation, whatever happens when one day I'm interested in these words of freedom.
I want freedom for my words, yet, to spend the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
But it became an informatic engineer.
Because it was much easier to digitalize words in front of a computer that is to recite words in front of a audience.
But a good day, in the pity of his country, they were leaving a big party with a scenery and a microphone there, in the middle.
Now, you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor, but imagine what a microphone means for a bubble.
But the desire of this young man to try the battles he had written, the comic battles were too big, and he didn't think about it.
I got out of the scenery, took the microphone and said, "Are you all coming out?"
I'm an informatic engineer.
I'm so good at the Internet that my first words have just been, "web, web," it happened exactly like that.
People laughed, and he was happy because words were using fluid in the water.
It was a magic.
It was something extraordinary.
But the most beautiful thing that this young man appreciated at that moment was that people no longer laughed with him, but they came with him.
So, at this point, one of my daughters would ask me, "Yes, Dad, we understood that you're you.
(Laughter) And then you're still forgotten, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say about power.
So, I would say, "Yes, guys, this is the problem of having the egocentric dad," I would say the mom.
(Laughter) But the power comes to us.
But first, I have to tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disabilities, of my debilities, people I had in front of me seemed more available, more kind, something strange, that is, they took out the best of themselves.
What is it?
What? What?
Very good!
I'm talking about my disabilities and they take out the best part.
And it also worked the opposite.
It's then that I became volunteer in a house that opens people with disabilities.
Or it worked.
That's it.
People, all the people I met, and who became part of my life, have taken out and are really taking the best part of me.
And this is wonderful.
But there's always a difficult moment, a bubble moment.
Because, believe me, finding a disability can be afraid a little.
But for those who are a father, or they're becoming a father, it's to generate disability, it's the biggest of fear.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Civil Hospital of Padova.
We were invited, me and my wife, who is in Cinta.
A doctor makes us bother in a very small stadium, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was only one seed, and makes my wife bother.
Take the paper and read trisomy 21, and the only echo I have in my ears are the words of that little calculation, at that point, for me, time is closed: "Dombia and Frey."
(Laughter) The doctor says, "So, gentlemen, maybe she doesn't have fear, but the genius' body is my wife," who says, "Yes, Doctoressa, but our son is a mask and a female, maybe she has never understood it.
My sadness to 21 is the Down syndrome, my wife answered, "I've understood very well.
But I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female, then the doctor is always more sponsored, close, and it's a female, and then I have that point of saying, "Oh, but I'm a misery!"
Well, we're not even able to do the mask.
In other words, we gave the seed to the doctor, (Laughter) because... (Applause) Thank you.
We talk a lot about this, but I assure you it was, of course, a very difficult moment.
The hardest of our lives.
Also because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes.
Anyway, after a few months, it came.
That's it.
Thank you very much.
For example, a wonderful one.
It's beautiful, it's also strong.
It's a bit like me, my God is a bit part of it, you've understood it.
And yet, the best thing they have brought in our families, the really wonderful thing is that they gave us all the best people, better than me, better my wife, the best of their brains, and all the people that, in some way, meet.
This is not power.
But we noticed one thing: that all the people we meet are very informed from the technical point of view of disability, especially from Dan's syndrome, we are all hundreds of speeds, analyses, we know everything.
But few, very few of these people, have had meetings with people, with disabilities.
And then, let's think a little about these things and tell our story, we decided to open a Facebook page called "Bone news and second year," where, without taking a series, but just for anything, elderly, I'll say, we tell the good news that brings us.
For example, a little while ago, Francesca came home and said, "Do you know they use as a school, and then we did this card where Anna says, "But is it true that sometimes you use Massaid√£o as they were made?"
Well, that's it.
And you'll be app, so this part here, or another one where it says, "But it's true that you say signs of Down syndrome and you don't say "fuck with blue eyes."
Well, that's it.
And it's said with Down syndrome, because we believe that words also have their importance.
Also because if we talk about Down syndrome, or you know it, it's simply a chromosome in more, an X in more.
I don't know, I'll give you an example: you've presented TED!
Let's add a small X (Applause) No, why do I give you this example?
Because you, today, to know TED, to talk to TED, to talk to people, have made a bit of fact.
So, the invitation is, make a bit of practice, and don't avoid the encounters of disability you'll have in your life.
It's personal, but also people around you.
But a very small recommendation: in this journey we can lose, because our tendency is always the one to put ourselves a gradually on, or a gradually below.
That's it.
To look at the eyes, you have to put yourself at the same level.
And in this sense, it often makes me lose.
That's why I like, as a politician modern, to leave my stories alone.
Well, I also did this will, with this segment, that in the language of segments, is the word "disability."
So it doesn't make you want to look for disabled traits in your life, to welcome them, and above all, remember that the fears you were able to look at in the face are transformed into courage.
Thanks to heart, really.
(Applause)
I'd like to be a particular character, a kind of mouse, that goes to Gandhi.
One afternoon, in fact, in a very simple way, changed my life, and I understood what my mission was in the world.
Actually, it wasn't for a bubble of birds, nor for a romantic encounter, as they told us, some narrators before, but for an orchestra.
It went well, I could go worse because I was thanks to a soccer, so I think I'm very fortunate.
Maybe many of you have understood, while you were cooking ortagi, to realize how much scared each day, how much is the percentage of scarce.
It's what happened to me a beach, just thanks to a soccer.
This thing opened my mind, made me change perspective.
From that moment on, I decided that what I would have done, what would have been my mission in the world, would be not to go to fail, and try to make the world a little more sustainable, starting from food.
Why food?
The food is the thing we have more freedom of choice, it's the thing we can decide for us, for our family, every single day, so it's a question of choice, but it's also a matter of environmental impact, because our choices feed every day are large part of our daily impact.
We want to translate it with an index, we could talk, for example, about ecological imprint, and it includes much more what we choose to order to the restaurant that maybe the way we dress or how we move for the city.
That's why I believe it's important to be, if not another perfectly aware of the choices that are done every day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution.
My word "ordine" is one, and it's very simple, rather it's something good sense and it's to optimize.
I'll say that almost more a word that refers to domestic economy, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the lives of every day, especially to what is our report with food.
To optimize means, for example, the way we make the spirit, how much we decide to acquire, so, for example, the thing to buy the right, what is indeed useful, to look for the most possible to reduce the spices.
You, obviously, try to use 100% of the raw materials, the concept of consumption, to optimize consumption and, above all, the way we compose the tattoo every day, the tattoo, so what do we really take to the table?
Descartes, I'm part of this project, so from the encounter with the fire, just from the end of the file, from the rejections, from what we usually use.
In front of you have a small example of scarce towards the first noble subjects.
We are used to do what I'm doing now every day at home, when we pull the wounds, and to separate them from one part there's the noble part that we use and on one hand there's the scarce.
The scarce, so the less noble part, is in average to less than 50%.
In winter, we also get to 70% because many vegetables have more protected parts.
What does it mean to optimize in the kitchen?
In other words, changing the approach to food means simply recovering these things from the waste, means having a different approach, seeing all these parts as unique together.
Let's take an example with the mum.
I can see it as a window, maybe I'm eating it like this, or it's scared, and I make a fantastic t-shirt that, if I buy a board, it's surely harder, the torso, the centrifuge, and I can also see it as a group of four ingredients, for example, the savings, I can also give them as a giant.
This is just an example with a product that should be familiar to you, but it's the thing that we should apply to every single ingredient.
Another example, one of the vegetables that took more time to love, to love 100%, I understand, for example, the zucca really likes me because the mouth is the real noble part, it's the one where the dust is focused on the mouth, and it's also the part that has more fiber, so a benefit for health.
But not only: with all internal philosophies, I can talk to a warm, the seeds, I can touch them or simply make them move.
Farming means something, I think it's a practical example of a very easy technique, but that allows us to transform, to appreciate something we all have at home and that we normally don't have a look and that we go on.
So optimizing in the kitchen for me is especially this: changing a little bit of its mentality and seeing with a different eye, especially the details, but all food, to spray them less and appreciate it to the maximum.
To optimize means to optimize consumption of water and energy.
For example, every time I have the toothpaste or vegetables, I can, in contemporary, acquire other things, maybe vegetables, it's enough to have a sky, it's not that it serves what?
In fact, every time I use a domestic reader like the wildlife, to use it as a cup, and it's not only a provocation, I'm sure that someone of you're turning the ship, but it's a very high cup, the temperature.
So I don't realize that I've bought a professional tool from 2000 euro, but you can simply use the wildlife every time you wash your feet.
How do you do it?
A very practical example: you take a glass like this, you have to be thermal, put a new example, cover with water, and you can see it in the middle of the dishes, so the window must be full of dishes like always, and then you have the work that you prefer, choose, obviously, at the sphere of the pieces and not vice versa.
When the work ends, your owner will be at the cow below or down, according to the wild you've chosen.
It will be fantastic because it will be harassed at low temperature, so much better than the owner class, an incredible consistence.
And you've done it to zero impact, to this zero, and moreovering a result that would hardly be observed with traditional techniques.
So, optimizing the use of domestic readers, I think I can give beneficial interests.
Another application to optimize this time to the tattoo, I'm even more at home in your feet.
When we were in war, there was a lot of food, we had a few proteins, we eat a lot of potatoes, of moths, of proteins, it was a party, and it was fine.
Now, the problem is opposite: we have so much abundance and we have a little tendency to put in the plate the doors of the proteins that help us.
Why is it a problem?
It's a problem because, in fact, if we eat too much patterns or too slow water, yes, maybe we put ourselves on the weight, but if we put ourselves in the tooth and protein, we are actually getting ugly, and also increasing the risk of developing some pathologies.
It's something that doesn't do us well.
The classic portion of the governor, but also that we make the table, that can be from the legumes to the fish, in fact it's too abundant, eating so many green and we really take a large part of our daily need.
Why did I put this thing into my talk?
In fact, eating more than what serves us is a resource spirit.
Surely something we could improve.
If for more these proteins are animal proteins, which have surely an environmental impact, it means, even more, if we did it at a world level, even in terms of public spirit for health.
The benefit of well-being of the symbol is, of course, for society.
I believe it's more efficient to try to convince you, to put a little less protein in the tattoo than to try to convince all of you to drop for animal products.
I'll convince you one, while maybe this thing I hope will remain in jail, you don't have to worry about eating enough, but not eating too much, this is the problem of proteins, and above all, try to eat them more possibilities by privileging animal products that have a low environmental impact.
What? What?
You're wondering.
Well, in other words, the next year there will be also Apple, and there's only a lot of people who talk about the food of the future, the future, I don't know how to say so much about insects.
Personally, I think I'm not part of our culture, I don't know if you agree with me, we're not a country of insects, and I believe that we'll hardly become it, but that, for more, we can feed vegetables, maybe not those who will be able to use it.
What am I talking about?
I'm talking about the opposite hospitals, which are with me on stage today, which have a little bit of the origins of the Trentin, as you can see, decided to go to the stage.
In my case, I have a representation here.
Why do I like the lights?
Because, any of us can produce them, they are a "gourm" product that is part of the Italian tradition.
Who of you has never eaten the spots?
Who would never eat them?
As you can see, ten years ago this number would be inferior, we would have had more lights.
Thirty years ago, a law has prevented us from collecting them, we were also a great development of professional producers, this has favored a great development of human beings in Italy, and we are countries that are extremely delicate, we just need to know how to do it.
To raise your lights at home, you just need a small hole, an orchestra, a bit of land, a retina, to not make them escape.
The lights that arrive, also by themselves, are enough to grab the food spices, or you can take the ova, and then feed them with the vegetables, so two times a year you'll have your collection in a sneak, like an orchestra.
They require a time of culture of about an hour, and then you can do what you want, so from the French bug, or richer or strange, surely they can give satisfaction.
It's a meat, among the other little bit of fat, that has many benefits, and that can, for me, become not only food of the future, but also a food of the present.
I think that maybe the next year, if I ask you this question, there are more people in the room who eat them and less than would never eat them.
I'm sure they need a small change of mentality and a supermarket of prejudice.
So, sustainable revolution.
I'm convinced that it can be something so simple, but I'm a very optimistic person, and so I hope, in fact, to have a little change, surely a change of mentality and the overcoming of prejudices, I'm aware that it really requires a small change.
To take the tattoo, to change the way we see all the ingredients.
The benefits are really many.
The units of me became revolutionary because benefits are really many, they are for our health, for the well-being, and especially for our happiness and the planet.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I brought two data with me: one has a community given with six facts, named by one to six.
The other one went with ten facts.
If I throw it any value from 1 to 10 to the same probability of getting out.
Now we play, you've launched ten facts: me, the one of six.
I started this game, I put a equal number, or bigger than mine.
Five to five.
Completely, have you seen the game?
To start with the 10 facts is easier, but do you know how to tell me about your probability of coming to this game?
A possible approach is based on experience.
I explain to myself, "I can start repeatingly the data and take notes of every avoidance."
After 100 years, I'll realize I'll win around seven or eight times every player.
A little bit of peace starts and a thousand launchs, I'll understand that the victory property is close to 75 percent.
With the increase of rivers, my stone based on the media of successes becomes more precise.
This, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed by the leg of the great numbers.
Then, if you have a potential to launch thousands of times, well, we can do it to a computer.
Your port has to get to launch them around 100 million data in only one second.
This kind of approach to a mathematical problem, the solution in mathematical problem is called "Metdo Monte Carlo" for this ability to simulate the case.
It's a very powerful method.
We can simulate a launch of data, but also the behavior of a fluid, or the evolution of a colony of batteries or epidemics, or even the challenge of financial interests.
To answer the data game, we didn't need any mathematics.
In mathematics, I would repeat the Monte Carlo's method a little elegant, as if we were abused of the brutal force of computer science.
For me, it seems rather a way of magic.
And for this, four years ago, I started my doctor in Monte Carlo method at the University of Borrik in Inghilterra.
It was the fire of the data.
I don't want to talk about Maths today.
I want to tell you a captain of my story.
Unfortunately, the magic of Monte Carlo, which gave me so much stretch, was devastated by the first week of PhD.
Many work workers, workers, are exceptional, or my work, a super-computer, seminaries and conferences are the orders of the day, and the two teachers who follow me are of an intelligence, competence and humanity, unthinkable.
But the doctor doesn't do it for everyone.
It has worked extremely difficult, technical, often frustrating, then based on innovative research.
Data to every winner, there are 1010 failed attempts.
The doctor can be a lonely path.
I spend most of my time in front of the computer or a statistical article.
To face these obstacles, it would be a very lonely passion that I hadn't seen.
As a movement, it seems a term that lives on a plate of people for a mathematician who studies the summer, but I can guarantee you that at that moment my mind was more than fertile, paralyzed.
A few months after the doctor's beginning to teach.
I was like that.
Think, teaching mathematics and English.
It's a 40 minutes.
I prepared more than two weeks.
But with that first lesson, if there was a fire inside me, of determination, motivation, finality, everything that was missing before.
And why is it emotional?
Why all that euphoria?
I didn't care to answer this question.
I felt rigid, I wanted to maintain this euphoria state.
And that's how I got married to the genius.
I started to live in lessons, in lessons, and it wasn't enough to be, I didn't go to a single preparation, I wanted to appassionate my students to get involved, to surprise them, and to make them entertain.
I tried to enjoy every opportunity.
I've got a diploma in universities: I've been teaching for two hours to the first year to more than eight hours on advanced costs.
The day was the job car, the more I became efficient, strong and determined.
And then, for me, it wasn't a job.
I had accomplishments in every aspect of teaching.
To prepare the lesson is a creative or stimulating process, a form of art.
I'm even interested in taking the tales.
The joy of the students, right or wrong that they are, brings a continuous learning.
And then there's the moment of performance.
The disaster becomes a shaman, and the classroom has a park.
It's not my sponsor.
The gratitude of the students also spread all my practice.
And I was talking about them as much as they were learning from me.
The third year's course also reaches a concrete recognition.
The University of Warrich taught me the award for excellence in teaching, as a young researcher.
The cost of my PhD, I've got many satisfactions, but this resonated inside me in a different way.
It's all natural, beautiful, winning.
In my little child I was experiencing something that goes to the long scale.
The most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to put their passions into fruit.
From that point on, I looked back to everything that had happened in so little time, until I got to that question, the first day of lesson, do you remember?
Why? Because in the world
What was the reason of all this euphoria?
That fire, that determination explosion.
Well, the answer I gave myself is in my way of being and in values I grew up with, and the values we've all grown up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects or goods without a stream that if they're going through more people, they're going to get rid of so many values.
A concert... Well, TED, this event, or a song, a book, a trip, or an opinion, even a moment of silence.
A passion, a talent, happiness.
From these goods, there's also knowledge.
I had found the value and passion for knowledge in the sharing of knowledge.
And my mind will be moving precisely in the moment I had tried to implement my students' minds.
In Inghiltery it was a fantastic experience.
Now I'm writing my PhD thesis, I'm telling you to finish in the next months.
That's how I decided my last step.
As you've understood, the passionate of teaching is big, but the university is not the only place in which mathematics and communication are found to give life to this magic of sharing of knowledge.
Let's see.
I told you this captain of my story, because I think that what I learned is shared.
The motorcycle method, for example, the fact that we didn't get to what we thought, or to find the motivational finality through the roads that didn't expect us.
And then, of course, passion as a catalyst of our talents and the culture of sharing.
There's one last thing I want to share with you: and to do so, I invite you to read.
It's a preparational edition of financial exams.
There are more than 100 students inaula.
I enter a good moon, I tell myself, "I'm in the cat, and I'm fine in the microphone, I'll sponsor my colorful feet."
At his face of now, I look for the voice.
There's already silence.
I think that the exercise has also prepared will allow us to go through all the key points of the course.
A girl, in the first row, asked me if I can give some indices on the questions of the test.
I didn't see them, but I spent the night Sabato to get the exams of the last five years, I collected everything they can expect on a scheme.
I couldn't find it in the end.
Another little boy behind me asked where he could find other exercises to prepare himself.
It's true, we've had little time for practice, but there's a lot of materials on the Internet, and where I work I've written it on the challenge of the scholarship.
They're satisfied.
Well, the show begins.
I was in the bathroom, but I often came with them to ask how to see.
Every point of practice, we need an element of history, we repeat the sticks together.
Someone was a very difficult question, but I've spent the afternoon on their text book, I've prepared it, I've finished it.
I look at them to make them take the breath, it's a direction, go!
I make the magnifying glass for the exams.
A group of students sleep, someone asks clearly, but most of them are reassuring.
The last student approaches me.
And I forgot.
He hesitates in the speaker, seems stupid, maybe he's looking for the right words.
But in the end, I was in the courage only to tell myself, "I only want to say thank you.
But even if you do it for us, nobody does it.
I'm alone inaula, I have a huge smile and a even more giant heart.
I think that maybe it's exactly the opposite to this world.
So, I want to tell you: mind and heart are highly linked, and for this reason, when the mind is moving, even the heart beats you strong inside the bed.
I'm in mind the heart of movement.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Music) It's officially the midst of November, in November, where we know Mastas, Bafi and Vander November.
Moving is the world's campaign, the life of men to grow the glasses for the whole month, at the scope of promoting dialog and the collection of funds for the health programs.
From November 1th, a lot more likely, the bottom's windows become the truths and sustained by the moths, the boats' brains, and they start to grow their own ambulant publicities for the themes that are often ignored from the male health.
In 2003, Mozamber was born in Australia, Melbourne, he collected more than 559 million dollar, finishing research projects against the prosecutor in more than 21 countries.
Movember has already become a global movement, so from Dario to Mosca, at Trento, we support research, we put ourselves down, we make a selfie and share it.
Being in Trento has been moving, asking our love to donate this movement, just like, the research was living in Bander, living in Trek Trek.
(Video) Narrator: Let's see how it works, how it works, how it works.
(Applause)
Good morning everyone.
Today I want to tell you how a bottle of birds has changed my perspective on leadership.
I was in the United States, I was doing masters research, and so a little bit of merit, I came to a bar, I carried a book, and as I often understood, while I read and while I was one thing, I started to listen to other conversations.
But it was also a copy that was talking about change.
He said to her, "We have to change the house, no.
You should change your attitude, right?
But why should we do this?
The change was a central issue.
Finally, my colleagues presented it in a very clear way.
What's interesting about the change is that, as I told you before the collection, we all face the change as if it were the most normal thing.
They tell you that you have to change, that it's normal, that you have to do something.
But in fact, when you approach the change, the first thing you have is beyond fear, you feel that in this change you are involved many people.
In the morning there are many people with different intelligences, each one of which has more intelligences, and you're there to measure you and say, "Well, but now what do I do?
It seems that from this issue of change, which is the most normal thing, in fact, you don't know how to go out.
The opportunity seems here, properly, from diversity.
How to integrate everything that has happened differently, I remember?
One day, my daughter, Carola, she was a mom at home, we had a friends' girlfriend.
Then at some point Ramacena says, "Dad, but why Alessandro Luigi are two men?
I said, "Man, we're really three men.
"No, no.
They have two.
"You know with mom."
I look at it, okay, I was already forced by the question, because then I never know what to answer to a child, especially if it's small.
I say, "Well, Carlo, they love each other."
So, this diversity, in fact, is precisely the one who loves to do something different, and this is a bit the difficulty, because if, on one hand, we want to create a change culture, on the other, we need to create leaders of change.
I've worked for many years inside companies.
Today I take care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and people.
It's not the most immediate thing.
The most brilliant leaders do this.
Now, always drinking this birds, at some point I started to write, I'm always in the United States, to write on a paper, the word "cambing," I sing this word "gambing," I start to put these words and I form a "craft," which, in fact, is just a prison.
It's a attitude that, for me, of course, this is a perspective of all personal, a leader today must have, that is to know how to take, but to be present and guide change.
The prison is an acronic: it's for creative and agent of transformation in change, that is, creative people of transformation and change.
What's the new element here, for me, at least?
The new element is precisely in the dimension of not only change, we are often called to manage change.
Thank you very much.
And then, in fact, what happens to us is precisely to do something else.
So, the perspective, the change of perspective I thought, is to do this leap, to do things, to recover the rules, to make the projects, to bring people from one part to the other, to be, and in this being there's, in the midst, a transformation that also involves you.
It's not that I do a project, I'm paid on the project, but what's the transformation I carry, and all this made it thanks to what?
To the creative thinking development, which is a little the leva that makes this transformation move.
Because in doing this, if it's true that I work on myself, on the other hand, I'm afraid to be afraid.
But I also have the permission to explore, to imagine new things.
A little the ability to dream.
Now, we have imagined this model through five fundamental pillars.
The first one knows in the other way.
The transformation means that each one is creative in their own way.
Finally, we don't talk more about creativity as something related to talented people, to genius, exclusively to artists, or to someone who, maybe, in business, takes care of marketing, rather than communication.
But it's something that everybody looks at, exhausted the context in which you find.
And if this is true, it's also true that you can learn, you can align your creativity.
It's simple: in the morning we started with a tunnel, with the brainstorming, it's one of the tunnels that allows you to align your creativity.
What do you do with the creative thinking?
Because working on divergent thinking and convergent thinking.
This is not enough by itself.
We need to take a leap and make a movement a little.
To start involving what the emotional part is, the sphere of emotions.
We've heard about emotional intelligence before.
Here's it: to reach the essence of your emotions.
Those forces, those who make you feel a hero, but also those who make you feel with fear.
When you feel that you don't have the courage and you have to take the leap and you don't do it.
Well, also those.
When you are aware of your emotions, you can allow you to suspect the judgment and to launch yourself in a generation of opportunities.
And the interesting thing is that doing this is not that you stay indifferent to the context, that is, you do a rule modification.
But you enter a transformation that is personal, the consciousness of your emotions brings you to do this.
We could quote the numerous examples of leaders who made these passengers.
I'm only doing this to get hurt in Italian camp, surely deserve marinetes with grams.
But it's also a bit like those who, like Lan, know that they're awarded to the other day as the company of the biggest global extension, just for innovation, and it's increased to 67%.
This is to say what the real transformations look at, as I say, inside, but also an impact in the context in which your operations are.
And the third point is precisely to work to create, in a responsible way, opportunities, let's say, to create the climate.
But in fact, I'm not so much for the idea of managing, but how much to nourish, because the real difficulty today is in supporting the leader to identify that with their behaviors can generate something that has a concrete impact inside the organizational contents.
What do I mean?
That feeding means that every day you build the context in which people can fight on ideas.
They can have a free spirit.
They can relate to each other, but they can also allow themselves to fail.
And this is not so simple in organizational contents, because there's always the Libya of the results, as if the results would reach themselves in only one way.
But from there, to lead the opportunity to build a climate with their own actions, I would also offer them the opportunity to do what, to explore new facts.
And to do this, it's not so immediate.
Then you don't know why we grow up with an imaginative spirit.
And it's a child to imagine something, and immediately does it.
If you ask an adult, he begins a couple of bad competitions.
I say it or I don't say it.
The drawing I've done may not be the best, the best I don't say it, the best I'm in silence, I start all this inner dialogue.
What's interesting when we're in this situation is exactly how do I agree with collecting the creative spirit?
And here, financially, the impact you have when you do this, when you try to dream, has an impact that is necessarily different if you have organized, even to reinvent the relationship with the client.
Because prospective is completely changed.
So, to return to that initial birds.
So, the idea is to be able to make a paradigm, change their own paradigm, that is, what?
To find yourself in the situation of being aware, of aligning the creative spirit, but to put yourself in a way of liberated to say, "How can I be curious today?"
In which way, today, spinning for Trento, or looking at people who are here, I can raise my curiosity, my imagination?
In which way, looking at people, can I find something that is not so unknown?
So the sense of the expectation we've seen before in the video is, as the guide is the flywheel for the development of the creative thinking.
But this clearly presents the courage, on one hand, to create physical spaces where all this is possible, but above all, to create a mental space, an emotional space, that is to give the permission to make things happen before yourself and then outside.
So, in a few words, the courage to dare.
Thank you.
(Applause)
We're going to land, to get rid of security belts.
How many times has it happened to you?
And the only time the possibility to see from the top, the most amazing, the most diffused invention of man: the city.
And it's also the only time you've probably heard of thinking, "But how is it possible that millions of people, for thousands of years, try these places to stay together, are massive in what we call the city?"
It will also happen to you for the head, an important question, but it's positive or negative all this.
But would it be better to make this phenomenon or limited?
This is a story that goes back in time.
Actually, this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest most populated city of the West.
As you can see, maybe it's not winning.
In this city, the longest process of history began, with the most unexpected sentence.
And the process is, of course, the process to the cities, and they started these two kids, then became quite famous: Kar Marx and his friend Hangel.
They were fighting for Manchester, and they didn't see what you understand when you do your weekend in New York or in Parigi.
Imagine: they saw streams, without leaves, poverty for everything, which of carbon particles prevented the view of one with the other.
Obviously, both wrote with the book, called the condition of the opera class in the city where the city of all the bads in the world accused.
For the city to be a cause of the investigation, of insecurity, of poverty, and there's no other way to limit this phenomenon as possible.
It was like saying a Malsano attitude, something necessary sometimes, but to contain.
And from this, throughout the years, we're from 1850, at the beginning of the 90s, there's also some tools to limit this phenomenon that was probably the cause of all the problems of the world.
The water of the urban science that you see here behind.
It's a tremendous thing that, maybe you know, some time known, that has bizzar tools.
One is called "regulation of lights," which is the rock for which, when you have to change a wall at home, you have to do hundreds of practices.
And then the pianity, the piano, that is, the idea that there is someone from the top that can imagine the future of a city in the next 50 years.
Just him, it's only in his head.
It's still worried.
The organization that you haven't met, everyone, but that I can even say, is appreciate to imagine in a centimeter of the city what must happen in the future, here in a house, here in a theater.
And then we also imagine the movies, the culture that is very controlled.
It's famous a movie, a series of movies in the 80s, fled in New York, fled from Los Angeles, where Manhattan is a city full of violence and terror, so much to drop it.
And maybe because you've seen the film, remember.
It becomes a prison where all the world's senses are launched from the top and scanned for forever.
What's interesting about this process is that, like all processes, this was also for the Italy a little bit far from 1845, it's about 20 years ago, the sentence arrives.
And the only case in science, such a sentence, is a feeling of total solution.
Not only reading the motivations of this sentence, the growth of the population, the demography, the environmental sustainability, the economic development, the creation of work, the ability to create knowledge.
In fact, this sentence also brings three important elements that motivate this ability that is the city to improve the world.
The first is density.
As you can see, my spices, my photo made from the top of my city, and the density, which is how many more people, how many more activities can be in the same method, much more this positive effect is verified.
The second is diversity, which is the fact that not only there are many things in a small place, but that many things are different, that are people of all countries in the world, people who love the bathroom, others that like me also ignore the name of the most famous soccer.
The third element is creativity.
This is a white night where thousands of people, for a beach, wear a board, a sixth at home, food and stay together in a beach.
Cativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
So, here's my idea, that the city as a solution is, in fact, a mechanism.
The definition of cities is no longer the greatness, the inhabitants, we are all used to confront this city for the inhabitants, for the bigness, for the GDP.
That's it.
The city is a mechanism.
A city works, solves the great questions of humanity, because it's like a black scenario: different interests, many individuals that come from stories, from regions that have different goals, because if they take a trip together in a car, they tackle everything the day.
Instead, the city can easily transfer such individual interests in collective well-being.
So the definition of cities is no longer a static definition.
The city saves the world as much as it can generate this mechanism of positive transformation.
So it's a city that can also lose its status.
Now we all know some cities in Italy, even big, that, perhaps in this moment, after a thousand years of history, have suspicious this ability temporary.
Other black, maybe never considered that, instead, in this moment, or for certain periods, they can be this virtual mechanism.
So we don't have to be afraid of the city, we have to go from mechanisms and tools of content of the urban phenomenon to tools that accelerate development.
I'll give you two examples of the work I'm conducting in these last years and that don't have fear of the Cuban phenomenon, but that try to feed this mechanism, with utopia and courage.
The first example is from Milan, and this is also the trip I've done for years with this map around the city, the idea is to name this is my idea, and they're evident some parks not all, but in the center of the city, ten minutes of subway, from the man, the urban park, bigger of the world, 72 km of green, as I did.
And that, going, for example, to see the maps of the city, we can imagine how the element of diversity of strength, not letting us build, believing in the positive things of the systems we live in, not letting us repair the cement.
I don't know if you all have in mind this one.
The second example is the one of a city to a few billion kilometers from here.
I've worked, it's called Buenos Aires, in Argentina, the capital, and a few years ago was put.
What to do with this city in 2030.
Everyone is spaventurated: Buenos Aires, more than in other countries, is the magnet of all nation, the place where everyone is looking for a possibility.
But this mechanism, which is the definition of the city I've proposed to you, is in some way conceived.
The power, also powered by a broader national crisis.
And what was the attempt?
But the only one is to limit the development.
However, with courage, shooting the big, with the same ability to believe in the power of this mental weapon, which are the cities, as with the vital park, even in the case of Buenos Aires, I proposed three strategies.
These strategies that accelerate development, and that you can see behind, a majority of anxieties, that is, a great population, and the creation of green spaces.
You see, this is the density.
The piano says, in 2030, we must not limit ourselves, but increase a million more in the city, building more inhabitants in more in the city, not only in the Argentina, but in the whole world, and the creative to gather.
And then, building a infrastructure system, also suffering, that allows us to believe even more in this development and accelerate them.
And then, as I said, social spaces, green and pedonal spaces.
And these three strategies gathered on the use of Buenos Aires, with us that the cities are the solution to everyone and the world.
So, maybe choosing the place on the end, look at the top, this great invention of humanity, you'll have in the heart a different feeling, and you'll know that question that you've asked you many times.
And maybe you'll be proud to live in what I call the century of the cities.
Thank you (Applause)
Words are important.
My method in acceleration doesn't go to our thought.
The words of our language are extraordinary.
These are vocational stories that are full of emotions and emotions, they are avoidant, they dismantle with our history.
To beauty is our language, and in fact that this beauty is later preserved, newly, I'll talk to you.
I'll talk about the montant way of the English, the province, motivated, often dark, of English words that, in a few years, are starting to become common.
But I'll take it a bit to the long run and I'll start to show you some lately lines.
They have many Latins on their teaches and the greatest universities in the world, and they show them with great pride.
Here we are in Australia, here we are in Hong, and there's a lot of Latin.
In Ghana, in the United King, in College of Ronda, and in the UN ITO, Oxford to Chicago, the United States.
Wald says, "Let's see in her teacher."
Not only: universities, proudly, say, "If you're in Latin."
London has a Latin motorcycle: Parigi has a Latin motorcycle, the Canada, the neusal 15th, has a Latin motto.
But not only that.
The American girl says, "I've always finished and it's the right thing, I've always done it in a thousand movies."
The British marine speaks in Latin, and even an institution isn't ready to be a passatist, like NASA, gives a motorcycle to the Apollo emissions.
Why am I doing so long with the Latin?
With the lights.
Because if there's a single place in the world where a Latin motto could be there, that's it.
That's it.
The Latin colour.
Have you seen, instead, what is the marvelous, touristic recent of the city of Rome has proven the human municipality?
That's it.
(Laughter) It doesn't even understand how we have to pronounce it.
Wow, Millendyu!
Wow, Mendyu?
What is this low-pitched basis?
What is this pollution, this circuit between two lights that touches any sense?
What are the five birds in the top?
(Laughter) (Applause) And one asks, "But why?"
(Laughter) But because it's when we look at all the malchildren of all the cities of the world, there's no one who does the unthinkable thing to store their name, to find themselves.
Let's leave a leg.
Just dogma.
Afterwards, in his feet, we want to give a key to the touristic side, just launched by the Ministry of Benicutor.
Very beautiful.
Right?
(Laughter) Not very beautiful!
I see you, Beautiful.
We are Italian and English in an immensely way of everything.
It doesn't like us, it doesn't even like the agnophons, the curious thing is this.
One, two style, speak, Italy.
Let's talk about Italian code.
I'm talking about Italian.
The most romantic language in the world, opposite to the world.
Keep the gold.
The most dominant language in the world, according to 120 linguists, in any case.
The fourth most studied language in the world.
They don't study the Italian to do businesses, the studio because they love it for the kitchen, for fashion, for the art, for the story, for Dante.
They study for this.
That's it.
And that's it: we're talking about the language of the angels, we're talking if it's here.
I don't know.
So, for example, the pizza achieved the world continuing to call pizza.
Here you can see the map of pizzeria in the United States, confronted with the NEGO, with the quantity of the same map of the businesses that sell Hamburg or Hotdox.
The pizza comes.
So, if the whole world eats and says, "Pizza, why are we here in Italy?
Let's see here: we eat food, we drink wine, Luca, the novel, Cathedan, in Milan.
And the curious thing, because in New York, if in the place of history they have to promote in the week of the Italian wine, of Columbus.
Because New York's speakers, beautiful and elegant ones, who sell food and wine, say, "Vine!"
Let's talk about another Italian excellence.
Let's go to food and talk about fashion.
(Laughter) This is what the greatest Italian journalist wrote: "The World Cross Frendley," directly from the passengers of the Flow Winter.
And well, we understood that the stages are no longer the ones of a time, (Laughter) but explain to you why I have to call, as they are famous in our windows, and the women we see in our rhythm of birth.
"Why?"
Try it.
It's cybergone.
No, they are in the heart.
It's the word of advertising, anxiety, advertising.
Anyway, this is the publicity payment of a noise in Spain and Pala, Spanish.
This is a publicity payment of beauty, breastfeeding, and French palm.
This is the same page in Italy, and it's English.
There are two only Italian words: the first.
(Laughter) (Laughter) He says, "Let's go back to our radicies and ask ourselves, "Landini, this is the union."
It's funny, it's always Catitalian.
Let's take care of it.
It's curious because, besides two Italians, one Italian out of two doesn't like a English word.
In 2012 we say that there are 58.
We don't know the English, we don't know it as a country, and we see it.
(Laughter) And here, it's to wait for the medical competences of the man who compiled this model of the ash, to be a supermarket, to linguistic competences.
Nevertheless, every day, for the small predistration, for conformism, because it seems modern, because we are controversial, we use a quantity of English words, not necessary, not profoundly inserted in the Italian language, purely accessories and useless.
We're colors, instead of the phone call, we say, location instead of the place.
I've heard that the nitrogen is the location that we've chosen for the helium.
The seed of a pattern is a location.
We say "compilation competition," we say "cast" because of the beautiful ideas.
If the workers can feel like saying that we have to shout a scope of fungi, a link of the disaster to satisfaction, (Laughter) with the unite business.
When it would be enough, we need to call a fridge and a genius to put this leyend of the clips.
Because then the business is always small, white and genius.
(Applause) The English and the email don't only speak companies, but also the media, the public administration, the government.
We have a leg of the State called Jobsect, and I assure you that the fact that Jobset doesn't make it easier.
I've forced the tennis players, which is a rock that doesn't exist in nature.
We had a bit of a house, in English, that there is no more sympathic, because it has an English name.
Here's a couple of months ago, after the study of the human mark, I thought I had to do something.
To communicate my dress, I invented two, three tools that can be effective, I thought, with the kids of my office, to put a initiative in the network to make military sensibilization on this problem.
Ratis is without spending a sun.
We simply put ourselves a bit of competition, of communication and of work, and a little bit of energy.
This appetition invites government publications, companies, media, to say it in Italian, and the first instance of the Kusk Academy, because it was facing this utopia of sensibilization.
We were expecting a speech, but not what happened.
In less than a month they've signed, putting names with men and say, and there are 70,000 people.
They signed youths, elderly, Poly Gloppies and people who don't like English, signed offers of professionals and designed pensionists, signed Italians to the summer saying, "What's going on in our language?"
And at the end, I'm not a dignity.
The film is all over the world, from Singapore, from Jedusalem, from the South Africa, from Canada, from Canada.
And it's something with a movement: I've spent hours watching these movies that grew up and reading the motivations.
"You can come from someone."
Italian is a right, but also a duty.
We are in novelty of FUFA.
If we think correctly, we pay other things correctly.
Do you work in a public administration?
It's help.
"Film, because I've studied classic waste, "Oh, I give work to economists."
The love in fashion has always had a risk press, it's not for the help of the three.
I don't think there's a date.
(Laughter) A great Italian and a decent of English are better than a English scenario.
It's Xixa.
And we know we're talking about it.
This is one of the most stretched: I have a new slam, but I'm talking about the Italian, "There's a shadow, you'll go to Rome."
Even because we started to lack decades of our language.
Why can't you measure it for a hundred years, it's a gift I've chosen?
(Laughter) (Applause) Even for Dante, for Montal, for Caproni, for Paese, for Bangardes, Bankata, I'm stubborn to feel relationships that don't know how to say "bigson of the TV," but they fill the company's bugs, but that's how it happens.
I say, "Because I don't believe that those who say "cool" are cool.
Film, because I've heard professors, universities that say displayed, instead, that visualized.
I'm filming because I don't know the English.
(Laughter) (Applause) First, because I decide to understand what politicians say who ask my vote.
And it's now that someone could finally take this initiative at 85 years old.
Thank you for the driver.
So, I said, an extraordinary echo to cross, because in the means of mass communication they've traveled this thing in zero, in red, and they've amplified it.
And this initiative is used in over 130 articles on the Italian journals, with an unimaginable social consensus.
They've talked together, grams and beaches on the stadium, on the public, but the reward, with great applause, also the Italy and the avenue.
He spoke about Wired and he spoke about Vani Tiffer, he spoke about Christian family, he spoke to me about Turing's menchine, he spoke to me today that the director did a study.
A transversality that is witnessed all the survey, even a little bit of here, is a bit in it, and that went to the depth of the roofs more than nicks and colors to the most popular ones.
Myspace is a great desire to reappropriate ourselves with desire and consciousness of our language.
This thing is finished in the newspapers, I also touched Miracipe, on the ship, and I went to the talk.
This tragedy of the age, I'm an Italian journalist, I'm a Dutch.
So, we need this.
And all this is something that is born from the consciousness of each of us, because the language is what we build at every moment of our talk, of our thinking, and of our writing every day.
So the hair is: let's all stop the Italian.
Do you remember, in conclusion, some reason to do it?
To operate the Italian, it helps us understand from everyone, and it's a fact of democracy, because it's understood a fact of democracy.
They don't want us rules, they don't want us, they want us good examples.
We need to ask the situations to give the good example.
Our language is everything: it's a value, it's a fact of more emotion.
We have to sell it, spend it in the world, because it represents us.
Knowing more crazy, touching every doubt, it's beautiful, protects the brain even more than a language.
But those who are crazy use one at the same time.
In English, besides all, we've seen it, it's easy to talk, and so those who speak, how they eat, speak better.
And then it was chosen to Leonardo, in the first of the newspapers of this day, the Leonardo who defined himself "Homo Sanza Liter," because he wrote in Bolgar, that is, in Italian.
It's always the structure, the way descent of the Italian language helps us express our creativity.
If we reinforce ourselves to express our language, we reinforce one of the peculiarities of the magnificent Italian potentialities, which is the saying in its mother language.
And it's still if our linguistic tissue is solid, we can pick up some strangers, why?
We must take it inside a tissue that is not broadcast and laughed, from a sense of urge to an excess, of feminist nor of misunderstanding.
Why do I tell you this?
Because the Italian is us, the Italians, with our identity, our approaches, our history, our opening to the world, that goes from our words.
Thank you.
(Applause)
What does a young Karghiver mean?
When a person wants, she begins to stand up, the attention is on that person, on her needs.
But if that person, even something that doesn't go, is your mom, or your dad, what happens?
What happens to you if when we breastfeed, or the environment starts to stay if it's still a child or a teenager?
When I was a teenager, I didn't have the idea of being a young writer.
As everyone went to school, I was smoking with friends.
But what's behind these photos that you don't see?
Before telling you the hidden part of the iceberg, I would like to take a step back, to always start from the beginning.
If I asked you what has changed, what's the same, probably, in part of the age, I would say we love the channels and I've changed the hair.
But what's the invisible in those photos?
What has brought me from my girl, who sees the center, to my adult, who are today, going through my teenager who sees in the screen?
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family.
I've grown up progressively until then I've traveled it.
No one called me health problem.
And when it affects one, among the parents, and it's still a teenager, they're your reference points, it becomes really complicated.
And if I told you that the health problem is a mental health problem?
And also the duty to take care of the domestic facts, which, like making the spirit, or knocking on the ugly, an excessive care of responsibility, fear, rabia, constant feeling of walking on the ugly, or talking with the doctors and managing therapy.
Or to be a victim of bubble, maybe because of the bizzar behaviors your parents could have.
But, in addition to this, we could have to manage their own emergencies, for which no one has prepared you.
As managing, the situation while your father or your mother see things that don't exist, the psychologists.
I had to have to do with alternatives, depressive states, without anyone prepared them to do it.
Or even assistance, sedentary, careful about suicide.
But, in addition to all this, having to continue to do the life of always, to go to school, to study, the reason why I'm here today is that it's added another car, which is often not being able to talk to anyone.
If we say that your mom or your child, a problem of physical health, a tumour, another physical pathology, it will hardly affect them, or it will lead them to the genuine catives, or the debt people.
Unfortunately, someone will consider you, as genetically committed, and the automatic destiny is to erase the same disorder.
If you try to say that your mom or your dad have a higher depression, a bipolar scholarship, or if there's no DNA to describe their behavior and say, "Mom, dad, something that doesn't go, the answer of the external world will be completely different."
Even today, in the whole world, physical health and mental health don't taste the same dignity and respect.
Even today, it's not perceived as a common good, that belongs to all of us.
And this brings a rhythm to understand what happens inside yourself and their love, a rhythm to ask and receive help often not to receive a cure.
And for you to be a child, the affection becomes even more heavy.
The climate that perceives around you, the difficulty to communicate inside and the family, the stigma, the prejudice, the shame, can bring you to having everything inside and not say anything.
But the loneliness, in silence, is a heavy car to bring for a minority?
How did I face the situation?
What's left behind those photos that isn't visible?
And behind that smile.
There was a heart that came to form in automatic, behind which I was born, a heart of ice cream that allowed me to have inside fear, rage and pain, to avoid that I brought people around me, because I had made me grow above others.
At the same time, there was also an help shout, a shout that couldn't go out, that nobody, even at school, imagined.
When the first grade started to open, in that pregnancy.
When, for the first time, light started to filter.
I still remember with affection, the psychologist of the family consultation, who is the first affected person in the family, with whom I was able to open, and that helped me, we have to see people around me, the retirement that could be supported.
The true and its own teams have been for me, the truth in the Internet, on the forms, the stories of other children, of other countries, thanks to the love for the lights that had brought me to the parents.
The stories of our parents with mental disorder are all different, all unique.
But there's something that helped me and that we have in common.
And that we are often convinced of being the only ones.
But it's statistically impossible.
In the world, we are millions of people.
Nevertheless, we are convinced that there is no other than we've lived the same things we've lived.
Do you know why it happens?
Because our children's stories don't talk.
Through the stories of activists, proven from Australia, the United States and Carada, I couldn't give a name to emotions I had tried and understand that they were natural to the reactions I had lived, but I could also see the positive characteristics that were born to face that situation.
So I took my first intercontinent glass from myself, I went to Vancouver, in Canada, for the first conference I spoke about, to meet these children, to talk to them.
And it was a moment of powerful positive or powerful spectrum, because in their view, the story I had lived, but also that one to write.
They've seen the pain, but also the ability to transform that pain together to have a change.
I've seen those positive characteristics of resilience, empathy, courage, will to change the state of scope that I didn't recognize in me, but seeing the reflection in them finally felt mine.
The encounter was a owner, an immense owner, that gives me energy even now.
And it's a owner that I strongly wanted to take in Italy, in Europe, to help other kindergarten, other children forgotten, to be able to pick up fish from their spices.
The desire is that no child, teenager, young adult, must feel alone when one, in parents, starts to suffer from a psychological disorder.
It's a huge desire that needs everyone's help, because other fears, like not rising, once again, to add the weight of the world on my spices.
That's how we get to today.
In 2017 together with other Italian children, Gaia, Carlo and Marco, we made the first Italian association created by children, and it's called "Comit," "People" and "Parence," children with mental disorders.
We gave the trip to a project called "Minida," which I wrote, and that I wanted to have between my hands when I was 15 years old, called, "When mom or dad, something that doesn't guide survival for children of parents with mental disorder."
And it's a project that came from below, thanks to crowdfunding, thanks to the help of people next to me, some of them are here in this room now, who have grown up in this same desire, gave us the influence to make it leave and make it happen.
This project has the harmful objective to donate a copy of this mini guide to all the schools and citizens of Italy, because no young man has no longer left alone, nor their families.
Especially the children of parents who are not aware of their disorder and are not even in the cure for their disorder.
We also have to think about these kids.
I was one of them for a period.
At first, when I thought about this project, I said to myself, "I'll never do it, how will I do it?"
But, of course, I asked people around me, also to the dark guides, proposing to tell, during a walk, in ten minutes, the story, and finding so people of the civil society that maybe didn't have lived these experiences, who wanted to become our posters in the change, from our part, to the library of their communities.
And now we were able to get to many regions: Walda Aosta, Sicilia, Sardegna.
Let's stop, we want to reach all.
Another desire we have is to move the institutions to do more for us, but also civil society, and invest more in mental health.
Another enormous desire that we are doing is to find schools, to talk to students, with the kids.
Not only the Greek figures, but everyone.
To be able to see a wedding of the attacks, to face those that are the positive and negative emotions, the challenges of life, starting to act before it's too bad.
To save lives.
It's a long and tortuous path, what we have in front of us, but if there's something I know, it's the will to change the state of scope.
And that's why I know that the girl will make her desire, even thanks to you.
If this story had touched you, moved you, spoke to you, told your friends, to your friends.
Let's open that door that for us wasn't opened.
We make the light enter.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Today I want to talk about a special person: Aron Sfarz.
When they have dedicated them to a documentary last year, in 2014, they've intitulated the Internet "on boy," the pupil of the Internet.
It's very difficult to put money in precise categories.
It was an activist, a programmer, a researcher.
I'll surely judge a hacker in a bubble sense and an intellectual, a writer.
But it's easier to make a list for how much technology of projects he has collaborated, are dozens of dozens.
Aron, at 14, was in the group the rest wrote.
Maybe you don't say a lot, but it was a bubble in the block until ten years ago.
And it's built, at 15 years, the "como" creative dealing with the technical part.
Creativity Common is around in a billion content.
In free science, they create the most flexible and open copyright.
For example, I'm the license of Wikipedia.
Aronna, 20 years old, becomes a small start-up.
It constructs something to co-found something called reddit.
It becomes a millionaire for one day to the other.
They honestly didn't freeze the money.
I keep doing what has always done: building a free, open and collaborative Internet.
Collabora with Intertar Cive and Open Liberary, two digital libraries that are literally saving the web, preserving earthquakes and earthquakes of Internet, which would be highly lost, are digital memory archives.
It becomes one of the protagonists of the fight against SOPA, a valuable leg that a few years ago costs even Wikipedia to do Shopper, to go to Blockchain, because it would have limited the freedom of expression on the Internet.
What Nareon absolutely harvests is an extraordinary, wonderful and fertile, curiosity.
Aaron tells us the same in his blog and he was able to read up to 150 books.
Every wise: from the economy to political theory, to the history of education, to computer science.
It was spinning with the capital of March under the arm at 16.
Aron and this I tell you about her in a very tough moment of the documentary you must absolutely see, and she had learned to learn prestigiously.
He told us his mother that at some point she was cooking, and aaron was two and a half years old, she was seduced in her yelon and she had just attacked her friends.
But they discovered something important.
You're aware of a mirror, your partner, that is, famous knowledge, becomes a woman to share knowledge, because knowledge must be shared.
If we look at the aron projects, we see that they are all technological tools for access to information.
In the CIV Internet preserve memory, the RSSS allowed the blogs to synchronize themselves, the comfortable creatures are a copyright, so they make accessible to the people of content, the creative content.
The access of information is born from an extremely simple, but fundamental thing for the bank, which is the information to be able.
The feeling of being able that we're going to think for a second, we're everywhere.
In schools, in libraries, at university.
The power information was said in Milan, it also said the Montessori.
To give access to information to people means making a democratic act.
Democracy is literally based on giving access to learning, to education.
Without this, there is no democracy.
It's an act of empowerment, of ability to others.
The fact that Aaron came to this genius, from his cultural land, which is the one of the Aker.
Maker as a constructor, not as a writer.
When you know the code and you have the skills to read it, you can change it, you can make it yours, you can do what you want.
So explaining the world becomes a necessary condition to get the world, to make it unbearable, to be able to change it.
To make the world a better place presents an access to this information.
So if all institutions are social, they are made of people, so, fundamentally, they are culture, so they are fundamentally made of words.
Everything becomes hackable when you know the code and you know how you change.
But this thing doesn't do it by itself.
If the world is open, everyone will be able to adjust it.
To make the world a better place doesn't become an act of eroism, but it becomes an act of collective construction.
In 2011, Aaron is interested in this thing called Open Hazes.
A great movement for free access to scientific literature.
The world of scientific literature, maybe there's some universities in the room, is an absolutely chaotic and controversial world.
Many big editors have the keys of power, making scarce what scarce is not, that is, scientific information.
And Aaron is passionate about the subject, she writes this thing called Open Higgery or Manifesto, she writes it among the other here in Italy.
The first sentence was power information.
Around scars dozens of thousands of articles, hundreds of thousands of articles from a academic Data, Gestor.
It's scholarship.
M.B. had waited for it.
A genius attack isn't surely not seen.
It understands that its opportunity to make a mistake, an example.
They want to give an example condemn to show all the hackers out there that the world doesn't change with a rich couple of code.
I was already made of a real and its judgment: to have scared hundreds of thousands of articles from the academic and I could do it, but not in such a scale.
They are contained ups of computer surgery.
It's risky until 35 years.
It depends on millions of dolls in this legal cause.
And it's more or less equipped with a terrorist.
Two years later, his first rest, they started in Picca, at home, in New York.
I was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it, because information is power.
And if I decide to be the engrance that holds the system, well, these will scholize you with all the combined strength of the engrenage around you.
It's something we've already seen recently, with Edward Snowden, Cesimanning, Giulia Nassaii.
All different cases, pure similar.
People wanted to give access to information, for how much controversial.
I'd like to make you see now a minute, from the last year's interview, a few months before dying.
(Video) (English) Have you ever heard of the Fairy's faith?
That's it!
But even now all of you get there.
Now, let's see a little bit of this: we'll have to admit that it's going to be a bit more frightening, that's why it's a bit like this.
I went to UFES to Krakind inside Spotlight, in Rio Grande do Sul, etc.
(English) Have you ever thought about something?
Line is giving good, it's a good failure in the month, in the United States.
It's very good for us to get angry, exhausted.
This is Alexander, one of the world of the universe, but he doesn't have a chance.
(Laughter) In Switzerland, I'm going to start, I know how many myths have already done, there's a bank thing as fundamental.
There are two polarized perspectives of the Internet: the Internet is horrible, it's a mass sponsor platform.
I've used it to spare, to control, to oppress.
And there's another perspective: fantastic Internet, free, a place of total freedom and freedom of expression.
Actually, these things are the same: they are green and environments, they are things that exist in the same way.
A pleasure to be just one thing.
It's an important thing: Zaptuas depends on us what will come from, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing.
I wanted to finish not with my words because I don't have them, but with words of someone younger.
To make living isn't something that will be, if there's one, it's what's already here, the hell we live every day, that we train together.
Two ways are to not suffer.
The first one is easy for many: accept the hell and become part of it until the point of not seeing it anymore.
The second risk requires attention and learning continues: looking and knowing who is what, in the midst of the hell, is not hell, and making it last and give them space.
(Applause)
Good afternoon everyone.
In 1950, while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the mess of the hospital's lab, and I asked myself, improvement, I solved the look of the tattoo and where all of them are.
And I didn't talk about other comments, I was thinking about the extraterrestrials.
It was impatible.
No, I had made a reason.
In our galaxy there are hundreds of billion stars.
Most of them are more old than our Sun, the oldest 13 billion years, our Sun, the Earth, have four billion and a half years.
So, if life was appeared in some other planet around one of these very old stars, so much before that on Earth could exist in the smart species, incredibly more old than ours, incredibly more advanced from the technological point of view.
Maybe they would already be traveling between the stars.
But we've never been contacted by any of these intelligent hypotheses.
It's from here the question of closing, I mean, where are all of us?
It's something that can create some curiosity, can unfortunate.
And in fact, during the years, many approaches were identified to answer this question.
It has been very possible answers to some very fantastic things, but the simplest thing is that there is no one out there, that we are alone.
So, is this possible?
I believe that this is a question that we've all asked ourselves, first or later, in life.
I, at least, do it forever.
When I was a child, I looked at a stell sky, I asked myself if, around those luminous dots, they could be part of the planets, on those planets of living beings, that maybe at that moment, were looking at my direction and they were asking me the same question I was anchy.
Now I do astrophysics.
I would like to find a scientific answer to this question: are we alone in the universe?
And I really believe that finding evidence that there is life out of the Earth would be a vocal change for our species, for understanding, also, of the place we occupy in the universe.
Four centuries ago, Copernical Revolution has told us that we are not physically at the center of the Union.
There's no center in the universe, because there's no center in the universe.
A century and a half ago Charles Darwin explained to us that our species is learned with all the other species of the country.
In fact, we all come from a single common antenna.
And I mean, finding the scientific evidence of other worlds inhabited, I believe it would be a third great revolution, paragonable, and maybe even better, to other two, forced.
Well, in the last years we've surely done many steps in the direction of a possible answer.
We still don't have a answer, but we are the first human beings to have the scientific tests around other stars.
This is one of the great novels of astrophysics, of the last 20 years.
In many years, 20 years ago, we could suspect it, that there were other planets, the outside, but now we have the prove.
We know thousands of planets around other stars, and we can say that, very likely, each bottle of our galaxy has at least a planet.
So we're talking about gigantic numbers, hundreds of thousands of planets out there.
And we know, in fact, we also know that many of them are at the right distance of their bottle to have a temperature that would allow the presence of liquid water, so of husbands and oceans on their surface.
And this is one of the requirements we give them indispensable for life, as we know it.
Even, according to some statistics that could be in our galaxy, 11 billion planets potentially related to life.
On the other hand, the potentially because we are really moving the big steps, so we still don't have the definitive evidence that one of these planets is, indeed, inhabited.
But we have tools that are studying them and in the next years, from the debt of the lights that happen to us, for example, if they have an atmosphere, that the elements are made of this atmosphere, so to understand if, indeed, there are the conditions for the presence of life and even in a future, not too far away, we could escape from these planets.
I hope that we can all be testimonies in the arch of our lives of the moment of gender, because I really think it would be an epocal change for all of us.
One of the questions we can ask ourselves is that we will never achieve these other planets.
And the answer is: don't prepare the allies, no, because they're incredibly far away, they're separated from us from a ocean of void space, the universe is really very big.
And then I'll give you an example, a concrete example.
This probe, my spices, is Jerune's voice.
Because the space vehicle built by man who is farther from the Earth, and traveling for a quarantine of years, came to the extreme confinements of the Solar System, entered the Space Space Space, 60,000 kilometers per year, 17 kilometers per second.
So it's a huge speed.
But how much would this space probe happen to the closest bottle in our next centuries, ourselves, traveling in that direction?
It would put us 74,000 years, which is a longer time than any human civility existed on our planet.
Can we do better?
Of course, we could do emails.
But also the light that travels to the massive speed in nature takes more than four years to do this path and the other stars are incredibly farther than that.
So it's also simply communicating the radio with other systems that would require hundreds or thousands of years of the lesson of a response.
So it's very complicated.
Maybe we're not alone in the universe, but we're surely alone, we're lost in a sea of bubble spaces.
And then, for me, there's one of the things to have present when you try to give an answer to the question of ferms, and then the question, in fact, that we all have, that is, where all of us are.
And the fact that having the present is the subject.
So let's talk about time.
I use an example of the Geom McFi's writer.
The distance between the tip of the dates of my hand on the screen and the tip of the dates of my right hand is the time between the formation of our planet, the Earth, and today, four billion and a half years.
Very good.
The first forms of life, the cell phones, the antennae, that is, of all life forms, never appeared on our planet, including ourselves, compassionate enough, compassionate here, somewhere in the palm of the screen.
Then, these microorganisms dominate life on Earth for a long time, are replicated and differentiated thanks to natural selection, evolution, and only here, in the dust of the right hand, there is the explosion of the forms of multcellular organisms, the most complex parts of a network of thousands of cells, the animals, the plants.
The dinosaurs appear here, at the end of the palm of the right hand, and at the beginning of the last speaker, a natural, catastrophic event, very likely the impact of a great asteroid, the space via the Earth together with three rooms of living species in that moment on the planet.
And from this kind of small, big, there were many times throughout this long history of life on Earth.
Even if it calculates that 99% of the species has never lived on this planet are extinct.
So this gives us an idea of the fact that this long story, the path of the evolution of life on Earth, was a long, difficult path, accidented, governed by unpredictable events, and that I didn't have to necessarily bring to the origin of the most complex organisms.
And less than ever had to bring to the comparison of our species: Homo Sapiens.
That's how we are in all this.
Well, the whole history of humanity is in the tip of a wave.
We could completely can change the path with a lime.
And this has already happened, because today we know that for dozens of thousands of years on our planet, they have lived with us other human species that are no longer like Neanderthal.
So here, maybe, there's a bit the key to everything here.
If one day, as I hope, we will discover that there's another life in the universe, it's very likely that it will be microorganisms.
The first extraterrestrials could be simple.
The fat could be dominated by microbes.
Intelligent species could be rarely, and even their existence could be beautiful, transcurable, regarding the times of life, and the times of the universe.
Maybe they are the same intelligent species, but sometimes a certain technological progress level, to self-esteem.
Or, simply, they imply, they collapse, without leaving any track in the environment.
So maybe this great cosmic silence that uncertainty encourages us, maybe even a little, a kind of advertisement, maybe it's telling us something.
Life had to overcome a great number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we could have in front of us.
After all, we think of ourselves, our species, from far away, we imagine ourselves from another planet.
If we really disappeared, probably in the universe, no one would ever be aware that we were.
We are a very young species.
As soon as a century we started to fly, to communicate, to see.
From a 50-year-old girl, we send waves in the hospital.
In fact, we arrived at the facts of the Solar System, but we've just put the foot in this big ocean of the cosmos that surrounds us.
I think that getting here would really be a bit like a peculiar.
We, unlike dinosaurs, have, at least in part, the chance to change, to influence our destination.
We surely have the ability to get autonomous.
But we also have, as I believe, and I hope the possibility to use scientific knowledge and technology to face the problems we'll have in front of us, to guarantee a long future in which we'll continue to discover the other stars.
And then, if there are super-inteligences that, as you can see in the science movies, then the only hope to be part of the club of these galaxies is to survive the longest possible, we have hard.
If we were alone in all this space, then I believe that even more we have the duty to keep access so that we can get this wonderful, part of a small planet, lost in the bubble of the cosmos.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The story I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not from the sport made of victory, not of the sport made by those who arrived before classified, but the sport made and that generates positivity and positive for others.
A sport that, probably, then you'll like to believe you, gives us the strength to move forward, the strength to believe.
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running, yes, because I like to run.
And here I was in Namibia, during the first stage of a long trip, a trip made of 104 kilometers, which later became 100 seeds, including two, because there were other few.
No, in addition to two, because you're an important number and you're a number that will return, in more moments, throughout this story.
And here I am, at the end of these 16 kilometers, with all the competents, who, instead of running, were worried about arriving the first or arriving the last, we were all together after these 100 kilometers.
The trip is the difficulty, it has already started from the first days.
We arrived in WindOC, inside the map, and after six hours of trip, it was quite difficult, we arrived in the desert of the map, the oldest desert in the world.
A beautiful desert, a desert with particular characteristics that I've chosen for this kind of guys.
And here is another casuality, the petorane.
The petoral that was taught to me is the number "yes" still, this "yes" that makes me a important number, it's an important number for me.
This is the first stage, it's the first stage in the garage, the first cover is a little like the metaphor of life: no, you start doing things, then during life, they happen the imprevists, so it's very simple: they do 15 kilometers all of us.
And also in the race, they happen to the unexpected, but if you want to take a challenge to a garage, or if you have time, you have to do something beautiful, you don't even go forward and know how to react.
There's always the possibility to react.
And I had the first difficulty after three kilometers.
And your thing is, "Mom, I'm not going to show you ..." (Laughter) OK.
I don't want it.
In fact, I couldn't mold Risinga, an important initiative to pick up funds for the fight against stomachs.
But neuroblastom is a tumour, it's an infant tumour that, unfortunately, affects many children.
I, before this experience, didn't know the existence strongly, and so my goal was to make these 1600 kilometers collecting funds to give an hope, unfortunately, there are many of them that are also hope for these children.
And when it happens in the desert, it's complex: running in the desert, because there's wise, it's very hot.
In the Namib's desert, in December, other stages run with 61 graders.
It's true that running to 68 graders is not like running to 61 graders with the level of humidity we have, but they're always sat down, right?
During the marathon, of 42 km, which is lasted for how much it looks at me at 7 hours of race, I had different problems: arms, bruises, scores.
That's how it was.
Why? Because we don't know
Because we had to move forward our house.
When you run alone, or almost?
This was at the beginning of the second stage, the one a little further, becomes a kilometer, so nothing dramatic, but it was a tap that started to make me think of a stage that also started to shake the land, the heat, which is in a desert.
The desert begins and taught me so much.
It has taught me that we often feel, during all our days, during our working activities.
We feel unbearable, we feel unbearable, we feel powerful, but unfortunately, in the desert we realize that you're a punctine, maybe where you go to you, and I run with 15, 20 kilometers where there was no wave, you realize how small we are.
And you also teach you that beautiful things of life are not only the cell phone, or the dress in the last fashion.
Many kids, to be happy, must have the cell phone at the last death.
And there I learned many things: from a young man who guided a bus on a pull, and at some point in the middle of the desert, a beach that we were going to eat was closed, leaving the pull, there was a ship.
There's the door, this paper, and he tells us, "You've used this paper, and this paper was a wild sheet."
He was happy, because with the salt I don't know if you know it, it's profound, and I don't know if you know that with the salt I can eat.
And I don't know if you know it, but what do I also do medicine?
He was happy for the savings.
Now we don't have to be happy, we just have to be happy with many other things, but it's also important sometimes to valuate well how much we are fortunate.
The desert of Namibia is the desert I've chosen, why?
Because inside the analysis desert, there is the highest Moon in the world, more than 300 meters.
And when you're there, we've done it as a race, or almost, you can see it there, on the tip, the flag that comes from the other side, and as if the sky touches.
Because in the desert there is no cloud, and so when you're there, it's something incredible.
To get out of the Moon is not simple, and I'd run little, old, I walked a lot.
And when I arrived at the tip of the Moon, I was already at the kilometer, but only six kilometers were missing.
We're already at the kilometer 100 that also corresponds to the highest in the world, here in Namibia, and I've done it.
"Well ..." (Laughter) Sorry.
Now, I'm going to tell you: four kilometers, four kilometers, three doors.
"But why are you walking well, I'm happy?"
(Laughter) Thanks to everyone who's giving you strength.
(Laughter) That's my puzzle.
Raise your hand.
That's it!
CF: Beautiful, I didn't fit.
(Video) Woman: Wow!
And I, in the desert, also found a quote this morning, if I spoke about the small principle of my pocket, and I found many people who shared me, are other 26 people, because it's a very happy woman.
It was 96 people who have traveled with me, in the end, the last two kilometers could also not do them, because the challenge was from 104 to year, and at the end a magic was made, an amazing magic.
As you can see, they were all very agile, they also had the part because the rooms were a bit rigid.
So these are us, why did the organization do?
The kilometer of distance from the arrival had put that flag to give me the chance to get there, to end the official war, can go back, to do another kilometer, to return back, to reach 1006.
Why? Because in the world,
Because the project had the goal, as I said, to get to these kilometers, it's to have inside the number six, important and richer number.
The interesting thing is that we arrived at the end, and the collection was adding its goal, the 20th December 2016 that if you take the numbers are exactly the numbers that do 16 kilometers, or 2006 for two, but I wasn't like that, so you don't worried, you can also run.
I was like this, maybe a little more, I had 40 kg more, I wasn't very sportsful, I smoked, I was sometimes captained, and I was surely doing 100 meters and I was already doing this.
I wasn't alone.
Sorry.
(Applause) Besides having a wife that's enough, one a little bigger, Riccardo, who's already 17 years old, and the other Pietro, who was six years old.
And Pietro, and Riccardo here, during the day of school, so three years of difference, this is the first day of school.
It's Riccardo, you have to go to the fourth and Pietro, in elementary, so big.
I don't know why Ricardo did his policies in his feet before, in the end, he had already understood it, it's the situation, but unfortunately, life, sometimes, is to look at us as the race, what I wanted to react.
And this is what happened.
This is a celebrating hemorrhage.
This is the picture of a celebral hemorrhage.
Unfortunately, Pietro had a celebral hemorrhage for November, during the first days of school, and this brain hemorrhage was caused by an arterovenous malformation that we didn't know during the birth.
And it has lasted hardly.
This is the last time I see it smiling.
When it seemed that everything went well, February 18th, 2016, unfortunately, they called us and had an infarction because it was too scary.
So the woman is called Ranna 100%.
And the number 6 P3 you've understood, right?
Clearly, I don't want to give a brutal impression, but I don't need to beat, and to keep going forward in life, and to give the possibility to the other two that came to Emma, and it has arrived at the age of 8 months later, so there are them.
I absolutely need to be positive, and I couldn't fight myself.
So I absolutely had to do what?
To be able to improve my life, to improve my way, not only from the point of view, we say so visual, but especially from the physical point of view, to be able to give the strength to people.
And to be me, stronger.
So I started running, the first image you see on the screen is my first marathon, at the Reina of Milan, and then another DNA, one year later, the first marathon, the queen will have a beautiful one.
And until we get to this guy.
After arriving to the Namibia desert, where these 16 kilometers brought me to win this medal, but to help many children, even if they needed it.
And you can see the magician, that symbol I've tattooed to you, and it's me, and I'm Pietro, and that's why I wanted to pick 2200 euros, which is 2002 for two, because I didn't have only run inside the desert, and they will continue to run alone.
This year, in November, it will be in the human desert, and the kilometers will be 165, so there are also many of them.
165 km completely in self-sufficience, so they only give me water, we hope to get to the end.
In the different desert, but the goal is always the meditation, that is to get to pick up the money to help children and help them better.
So the message I'll give you today is an important message: any of the difficulties we can have, big or small ones that have, there's always a hope for everyone to do great things and to move forward, because life is a little like a bottle, right?
(Applause) Thank you very much.
(Applause) Thank you very much.
Thank you.
(Applause) He says, "No.
We're here, and today it's 17th of 2017.
Three times you know, you can see how you want to interpret it.
Thank you all.
(Applause)
