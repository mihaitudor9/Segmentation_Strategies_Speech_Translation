(Applause) Have you found?
Power and fragility.
And some of you will wonder what they have to do, these two words apparently so far: you have to know that, until a few years ago, my two larger children, Mars and Francesca, to sleep, they chose two words.
And I, on those two words, had to tell a story.
Now, this thing doesn't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't.
So the story begins with the only child: Richolino, I'll tell you this afternoon, but interacted by an uncertainty.
Words were made to go out, they were just stuck in their mouth.
Anyway, the years pass, the child becomes a young man, but he suffers a lot about this problem of bubbles, it's so much that he proves to find psychologists, all the great people, great professionals, but nobody succeeded.
Do you want this uncertainty?
One day, he does a trip to Rome, and so, fortunately.
He found a old girl, called Teresa.
I'm sorry.
And this old man says to the young man.
When?
One day.
Would you expect a child?
Anything happens.
Not to be afraid.
It's so that everyone around me said, "Madre Teresa, but what a beautiful word of freedom!
Instead, let's go.
The young man thought,
I'm not.
Interesting.
To these words of freedom.
I want freedom.
For my words.
Anyway.
They still happened in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
Instead, it became an informatic engineer.
Because it was much easier to digitalize words in front of a computer.
What is to recite words in front of a audience?
But a good day, in his country's square, they were paying a big party with a scenery and a microphone there, in the middle.
Now, you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor.
But imagine what a microphone means for a bubble.
But the desire of this young man to try the battles he had written, the comic battles were too big, and he didn't think, he came out of the scenery and said, "Salva everyone, I'm an informal engineer, think that my first words were: web, web, web... That's exactly the people were laughing!
And he was happy because words were able to flow in the water.
It was a magic.
It was something extraordinary, but the most beautiful thing.
What is this young man?
At that moment, we realized that people ...
They no longer laugh.
From him.
But they came with him.
So, at this point, one of my daughters would ask me, "Yes, Dad, we understood that you're you.
Audience: Yes.
And then, even if you've forgotten, you've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say, "This is the problem of having the eco-centric dad," I'd say the mom, but the power comes to us, but first I have to tell you something very important, because when I spoke about my disabilities, my debilities.
Something strange happened.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more kind.
In other words, they took out the best of themselves.
What is a moment, I'm talking about my disabilities, and they take out the best part.
And if it also worked the opposite.
It's then.
They became volunteer in a house that opens people with disabilities.
But it worked.
It worked: people, all the people I met and became part of my life.
They've taken out and they're really taking the best part of me.
And this is wonderful.
I don't know.
Like in all the stories that are respected.
There's always a difficult moment, a bubble moment.
And why?
Believe me, finding a disability can make a little fear.
But for those who are parents.
I'm becoming a father.
Generating.
Disability.
Well, that one.
It's the biggest of fear.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Civil Hospital of Padova, we are invited, me and my wife, who is in Cinta, a doctor makes us bother in a very small stadium, with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was only seed, and makes my wife bother.
He takes the paper and read.
The trisomy.
21:21.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only one I have in my ears.
They are the words of that battle of calculation.
Dombia Freit.
Not to be afraid.
But the genius group is my wife, who says, "Yes, Doctoressa, but our son is a mask, it's a female, (Laughter) the doctor says, "Scuse, maybe she didn't understand, sadness is 21st century."
My wife answered, "I've understood very well, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female."
The doctor is always more sponsor, close.
It's a female.
(Laughter) So I say to myself, "But pork, misery, we're not even the same time we managed to take the mask from Niela, but the summer, we gave the seed to the doctor, because it's funny."
(Applause) We talk a lot about this, but I assure you it was, of course, a very difficult moment, maybe the hardest of our lives, even because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes, yet, after a few months.
(Applause) And even the best thing that Anna has brought in our families, and the really wonderful thing is that it has made us all the best people, it's better to me, it's better to me, it's better to the sensors, and all the people we find in some way.
This is not power.
But we noticed one thing: that all the people we meet are very informed from the technical point of view of disability, especially from Dan's syndrome, we are all hundreds of speeds, we know everything, but few, very few of these people have had meetings with people.
And then, let's put together these things and tell our story, we decided to open a Facebook page called "Boone news" and "Second Anna," where, without predicting ourselves, but just for nothing, elderly, I'll say.
(Laughter) Or another one, where he says, "But it's true that sometimes you use, but you've done this card where Anna says, "But it's true that sometimes you use Dan's signs, and you don't know, if we talk about Down syndrome, or you know, it's simply a chromosome in more, you've done an example, you've presented the TED."
Let's add a small X.
(Applause) No, because I'll give you this example, because today, to know TED, to talk to people, you've done a bit of factics, so I invite you to not avoid the encounters of disability that you'll have in your life, either personal, but also of the people around you, a little recommendation.
In this journey, we can lose.
Because our tendency is always the ones to put ourselves: one gradually!
A gradually below, here to look at the eyes, you have to put yourself in the same level, and in this sense, I often like to lose myself, for this, I like a politician to leave the bathrooms along my stories.
Well, I also did this afternoon with this segment.
That in the language of segments is the word "disability."
So it doesn't make you want to look for disabled traits.
In your life.
To welcome them.
And above all.
Remember?
Fears.
What were you able to look at the face?
They are transformed into courage, thanks to real hearts.
I thought that to make the revolution, I would like to be a particular character, a kind of mouse, that goes to Gandhi, and then a beach, in fact, in a very simple way, has changed my life.
And I understood what my mission was in the world, in fact, it wasn't a bit like changing prospective, and from that moment on, I decided that what I would have done, what would have been my mission in the world, but for an orchestra, it would have been to no longer give anything to failure.
And trying to make the world a little more sustainable, starting from food.
But why food?
The food?
And not only, so it's a question of choice, but it's also a question of environmental impact, because our choices can decide for us, for our family, every single day.
That's why I believe it's important to be, if not another perfectly aware of the choices that are done every day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
My word "ordine" is one, and it's very simple, rather it's something good sense, and it's optimizing, I'll say that almost a word that refers to domestic economy, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the lives of every day, especially to what is our relationship with food.
The concept of consumption, optimizing consumption, and especially the way we compose the tattoo every day.
So, what do we do to the table?
The scars, I'm part of this project, so from the encounter with the fire, just from the end of the file, from the rejections, from what we usually use every day at home, when we pull the vegetables, and to separate them from one part there's the dark.
The scarce, so the less noble part, is, in average, at least 50% of the raw materials, so what does it mean to optimize in the kitchen means to have a different approach, to see all these parts as one together?
Let's take an example with the mum: "I can see it with me.
OK, a mum, but I can also see it as a group of four ingredients.
For example, the dust?
For simplicity, I did chips, but I could also like it, it's natural, make a tortage, the bubble.
And it's also the part that has more fiber, for example, the zucca, I like a lot, because the mouth is the real part, and the one where it's focused on the majority of fibers - this is only an example with a product that should be familiar to me, but it's the subject that, for me, we'll be able to make a simple example, to make a woman.
Something we all have at home is that we don't have a look and that we go through, so to optimize in the kitchen for me, to change our mentality and see with a different eye.
In particular, the gardens, but all the times I use a domestic reader like the wildlife, every time I'm returning to the shadow, but it's a very high cup, it's enough temperature, so it doesn't happen that you can simply use the wave and all the times that you've been stuck, how do it?
A very practical example: take a broadcast, like this, it must be thermal, put it in a new space, take a lot of proteins, eat a lot of potatoes, polent bag, and when the work ends, another application of optimizing this time at the plate, even more in a doctor's use, I think it's full of dishes like always.
And really, when we could put the table, for example, the cards, the fish, in fact it's too abundant, and we have a problem because, in fact, if we eat too much patterns or too slow, yes, maybe we put the risk to develop some pathologies, so it's something that doesn't make us feel good, but if we put ourselves in the arms and proteins, in fact, in fact, we are affected.
Changing more than what serves us is a resource spirit, it's certainly something we can improve if for more these proteins are animal proteins that have surely an environmental impact.
In other words, riding them, being able to decrease their environmental impact, so I think it would be important that all of us would put a little less protein in the tattoo, it would be sufficient for a very environmental benefit.
In our health, it's simple, but even more, if we do it in a world's level, even in terms of public spirit for society, I think it's more effective to try to convince you, and above all, to try to eat enough, but not to eat too much, this is the problem that has no environmental impact.
What you'll be wondering, well, in other words, we're not a country of insects, and I believe that, specifically, we'll be able to use it, I'm talking about the opposite aspects that are with me on stage today, which are a lot of people who talk about the food of the future, which we can also produce.
I'm a gurm product that is part of the Italian tradition.
In the room, who of you has never eaten the spots?
Okay, who would never eat them?
Do you see?
Probably ten years ago, this number would be inferior, we would have had more lights of lights, about 35 years ago, a leg has prevented us from collecting them, we were also very delicate tastes, we only to feed them, but also because they are used for the cosmics and for other uses, but it's a food that has also been a little bit of light, a little bit of land, a retina, to not make them escape.
So simple, but I'm a very optimistic person, and I'm aware that asking you to cook the bottle, eat all the bubbles, start to think about the moon, there's surely a little change of mentality, and the supermarket of a prejudice, so a small change of course of a rain, and then you can do what you want, so from the ugly.
And above all, for our happiness and the planet.
Thank you.
(Laughter) I brought two data with me.
One, as a community with six facts, numerated by one to six, the other went with ten facts: if I throw it any value from one to ten to the same probability of getting out.
Now let's play: you've taken it from ten facts.
I, as you know, put this game on the same or bigger number of mine.
Audience: Yes.
Seven to five: compliments, have you seen the play?
To start with the 10 facts is easier.
But do you know how to tell me, approximately, what is your probability of winning this game?
I'll explain to you: I can start repeatingly the data and take notes of every victory.
After 100 years, I'll realize that I'll win around seven or eight times every play, with a little bit of peace and a thousand lights, I'll understand that the victory property will get closer to 75%.
With the increase of rivers, my stone based on the media of successes becomes more precise: this, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed by the leg of large numbers.
(Laughter) Then, if you have a potential to launch thousands of times, well, we can do it to a computer.
(Laughter) Your port has to get to launch them 100 million data in a single second.
(Laughter) This kind of approach to a mathematical problem, the solution of a mathematical problem is called "Metdo Monte Carlo" for this ability to simulate the case.
It's a very powerful method, we can stimulate a launch of data, but also the behavior of a fluid, or the evolution of a colony of battery of an epidemic, or even the challenge of financial interests.
To give the answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematics, a pure mathematician would repeat the Motor Monte Carlo as if we were abused of the brutal strength of computer science.
(Laughter) For me, it seems quite a way of magic.
And that's why, four years ago, I started my PhD in Monte Carlo, at the University of Borrik in Inghilterra.
Now I'll give you the data.
(Laughter) I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a captain of my story.
Unfortunately, the magic of Monte Carlo, which gave me so much, was devastated after the first week of PhD.
(Laughter) My workplace is exceptional, or my work, a super-computer, seminaring and co-ference are the orders of the day, and the two teachers who follow me are of an intelligence, competence and humanity, unthinkable.
(Laughter) But the doctor doesn't do it for everyone.
The PhD is extremely difficult, technical, often frustrating, then that it's based on innovative research, behind every winner, there are 1010 failed attempts.
But the doctor can be a lonely path.
(Laughter) I spend most of my time on my own, in front of the computer, or in a statistical article.
(Applause)
To face these obstacles, it would be a very lonely passion that I hadn't seen.
So, while movement seems a term served on a plate of argument for a mathematician who studies the summer, but I can guarantee you that at that moment my mind was more than fertile, paralyzed.
But a few months after the doctor's beginning, I started to teach.
I was so thesis, think of teaching mathematics and English for the first lesson of 40 minutes I prepared more than two weeks.
But with that first lesson?
If there was a fire inside me, determination, motivation, finality, everything that was missing before.
And why is it emotional?
Why all that euphoria?
I wasn't interested in answering this question, I felt registered, I wanted to maintain this euphoria state, and so I got a diploma in my students, I was passionate about my students, I was passionate about my students, and I wanted to enjoy, I tried to enjoy every opportunity, I got an efficient, strong and determined.
And then, for me, it wasn't work.
To stop the lesson is a creative or stimulating process, a form of art.
I like to look at the compounds, (Laughter) reading the students' ideas, just wrong that they are, brings a continuous learning, and then there's the moment of performance in class becomes a show.
(Laughter) And the classroom?
Each ocean, the lesson is my sponsorship.
(Laughter) The gratitude of the students repeated entirely all my practice, and I was talking about them as much as they were learning from me.
Well, during the third year, a concrete recognition came, the University of Warich taught me the award for excellence in the lesson as a young researcher.
In the cost of my PhD, I've got so many satisfactions, but this was all natural, beautiful, overwhelming.
Well, in my little child I was experiencing something that goes to the long scale.
The most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to take advantage of their passions.
At that point, I looked back to everything that had happened in so little time, until the first day of lesson, do you remember that fire, that explosion of determination?
(Laughter) The answer I gave myself is in my way of being and in values I grew up with, and the values we've all grown up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects or goods without a stream that if they're going through more people, they're going to get rid of so many values.
A concert ...
Well, TED is this event, or a song, a book, a trip, or an experience, an opinion, even a moment of silence.
A passion, a talent, happiness.
(Laughter) With these goods?
There's also knowledge.
I had found the value and passion for knowledge in the sharing of knowledge.
And my mind will be in this movement for me, in the moment I had tried to move the lies of my students.
In In Inghilterra, it was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my PhD thesis, I'm just defining in my last step, as you've understood, the passion of teaching is great, and communication is found to give life to this magic of sharing of knowledge.
But we'll be going to see.
And I told you this captain of my story, just because I think that what I learned is shared, or finding the finality of motivation through the road that we didn't expect, and then, of course, passion as a catalyst of our talents, and the culture of sharing.
But there's one last thing I want to share with you.
And to do it?
I invite you to read.
It's a preparational edition of financial exams: there are more than 100 students in class, a girl in the first row asked me if I can give a few indices on the demands of exams, there's silence, I don't see them, but I've spent the shop on a scheme, I'll be able to have it in the end.
Another young man, a little back, asked me where you can find other exercises to prepare yourself: it's true, we've had little time for practice, but there's a lot of materials on the Internet, and where I work, I wrote it on the challenge.
But they're satisfied, well, the show begins.
(Laughter) I wrote the bathroom, but often I came to them to ask how to get, at each point of the practice, we need a very difficult element, but I've spent the Domenica on their text book, I've always prepared it, I've finished it.
(Laughter) I get married with them to make them take the breath.
It's a direction, it flies, I make the magnifying glass for the exams, a group of students sleep, someone asks clearly, but most of them are reassuring.
But a last student approaches me.
And I forgot.
He hesitates in the bathroom, he may be looking for the right words.
And in the end?
I found courage, just to tell myself.
Returning.
But I only want to say thank you.
(Laughter) Because what do you do for us?
No one does it.
Because maybe I stay alone inaula, I have a huge smile and a even more giant heart, and I think, "It's exactly the opposite to this world."
So, I want to tell you, "My hearts are salty legs, and for this reason, when the mind is moving, even the heart beats you inside the bed, I'm in my heart and movement, thank you.
It's officially started the month of November, from 2003, the Movender's Modern Movend, who is asking our love to donate the Mr. Globo's movements, we make a selfie, and we share it, we keep the research, we put ourselves down, we put ourselves down the bottles of Bafco, and start to promote the dialogue and make them prepare a global movement.
Good morning everyone, today I want to tell you how a bottle of birds has changed my perspective on leadership.
I was in the United States, I was doing masters research, and so a little bitmer, I came to a bar, I carried a book.
And as it often captures me, while I read, while I read one thing, I started to listen to other conversations, there was, in front of me, a copy that was talking about change, he said, "We have to change your intelligences, not all of you have to do this, meaning, change."
It was a central theme: in the morning, my colleagues presented it in a very clear way.
What's interesting about the change that, as I said before, is the collection.
We all face the change as if it were the most normal thing, they tell you that you have to change, which is normal, that you have to do something, but, in fact, when you approach the change, the first thing you have is beyond fear.
GV: You feel your diversity.
Experiments your diversity, you feel far from the goal.
You feel that in this change there are many people, in the morning there are many people with different intelligences, each one of which has more intelligences, and you're there to measure you and say, "Well, but now what do I do?"
AC: It seems that from this issue of change, which is the most normal thing, in fact, you don't know exactly how to get out of it, and the opportunity seems to be here, instead of diversity, to integrate.
All that has put me differently, I remember, one day, my daughter, Carola.
It's a mom at home, we had a friends' partner, then at some point the machine says, "Dad, but why, Alessandro Luigi, there are two men, I say, "Man, we're really three men, and she says, "No, no, no, no, no, you're with mom."
So, this diversity, in fact, is precisely called milk.
To do something different.
(Laughter) It's precisely to build, to modify, to find a response of meaning.
But this is a bit the difficulty, because if, on one hand, we want to create a culture of change, on the other hand, we need to create leaders of change that I've worked for many years inside companies, I've been taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and with people.
So, always drinking this birds, at some point I started to write, I've always been in the United States, to write a paper, the change, to sing this word "gambing," I start to put these words into account, and I form a "counting."
Thank you.
Cacha!
In fact, it's just a prison, it's a bit the attitude that, for me, of course, is a perspective of everything personal.
A leader today must have, that is to know how to take, but to be present and guide change: the hunger is an agent creative of transformation and change.
So, what's the new element here, for me, at least, the new element?
It's precisely in the dimension of not only change, we're often called to manage change, meaning, management.
And then, in fact, what happens to us is precisely to do something else.
So, the perspective is the change of perspective that...
And all this made it thanks to what involves you, it also involves me, it's not that I've thought about doing this leap from doing things, recovering the rules, I do a project, I'm paid on the project, but what is the transformation I carry?
(Laughter) Because in doing this, if it's true that I work on myself, on the other hand, I'm afraid to be afraid.
But I also give myself the permission to explore, to imagine new things, a little the ability to dream, to this model we have imagined it through five...
Fundamental pillars: the first one knows where the transformation is.
Each one is creative in their own way.
And finally, we don't talk more about creativity as something related to talented people, to geniuses, exclusively to artists, or to someone who, maybe, in wife, takes care of marketing, rather than communication, but creativity is something that looks at everyone, has the context in which you find.
But if this is true?
It's also true that you can learn, you can align your creativity, what you do with the creative thinking, try to work on divergent thinking and think convergent, but this is not enough, you need to take a leap.
To make a movement a little deliberate, right?
So, starting to get involved in what the emotional part, the emotional sphere, the hope of emotions, we've heard about emotional intelligence before, is also when you feel that you don't have the courage, and to make the leap, and you don't do it, those forces you can allow you to suspen the judgment.
And to get involved, instead, in a generation of opportunities.
And the interesting thing is to do this.
It's not that you stay indifferent to the context, that is, you've only done these passengers to get to the Italian camp, surely merit, marriage with a group, but even a few people who, like the company, have done this for innovation, and it's still access to 7% - this to say what?
KA: The real transformations.
They look at, as saying inside, but they also have an impact in the context in which your operations, and so the third point is to work to create in a responsible way.
Opportunity, we say, in general, to create the climate, but in fact, I'm not so much for the idea of managing, but how much to nourish, because the real difficulty today is in supporting leaders.
To identify that with their behaviors they can generate...
Something that has a concrete impact inside organizational contents, what do I mean?
That feeding means that every day you build the context in which people can fight on ideas, they can have a free spirit, they can relate to each other.
But they can also allow themselves to fail, and this is not as simple as if the results would reach themselves in only one way: from there, but from there!
Is it the leader the opportunity to build a climate with their own actions?
I also offered the opportunity to do what, to explore new facts.
And to do this, it's not so immediate: then you don't know why we grow up with an imaginative spirit that is a child to imagine something immediately, if you ask him an adult.
Well, there's a bit of competition, but I say it or I don't say it, the drawing I've done, maybe it's not exactly the best, better than I don't say it, better than I'm in silence, I start all this inner dialogue, then what's interesting when we find ourselves in this situation, how do I do it?
Give me to collect the creative spirit.
It's here.
Specially, the impact you have when you do this, when you design, has an impact that is necessarily necessary.
It's different if it's an organizational context, even on reinventing the relationship with the client, because the perspective is completely changed, then to return to that initial birds.
So, the idea is exactly.
To be able to do a paradigm, change their own paradigm, that is, what?
To find yourself in the situation of being aware.
To align the creative spirit, but to put yourself in a way of liberated, to say, "In which way I can be curious, in which way, looking at people, I can find something that is not so unknown."
So the sense of the tension we've seen before in the video is, as the guide is the flywheel for the development of the creative thinking, but this clearly presents.
The courage, on one hand, to create physical spaces where all this is possible, but above all, to create a mental space, an emotional space, that is, to give the permission.
To make things happen before you.
And then, in a few words, the courage to dare, thank you.
But we're going to land.
To get rid of security belts.
How many times will you be able?
And it's the only time it has the chance.
To see from the top.
The most amazing, the most powerful, the most broadcast invention.
From humans.
The city.
And it's also the only time you've surely understood how to think, but how is it possible?
What millions of people!
From thousands of years?
Try these places to stay together, they're massive.
They choose to live not all separated, but together.
In what we call "city."
And will you also go through the head?
An important question, but is it positive or negative all this?
But would it be better to potential this phenomenon?
Or to limit it.
And this is a story that goes back in time, in fact, this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest most populated city of the West.
And as you can see, maybe it's not winning, and in fact, in this city.
It started.
What we call.
The longest process of history.
With the more unexpected sentence.
And the process?
And of course, the process has the cities.
And they started these two kids, then became quite famous: Kar Marx and his friend Hangel.
They were passing for Manchester.
And they didn't see what you understand today when you do your weekend in New York or in Parigi.
Imagine.
They saw streams, without leaves.
Poority for everything.
Following, but not the one of today, the true smoke that was like this.
That carbon particles prevented the view of one with the other.
And of course, both wrote a book.
It was called "the condition."
The operating class in the cities.
In which the city accused, of all the bad guys in the world, was the city to be the cause of the investigation, of insecurity, of poverty, of all the bad people in the world.
And there's no other way.
That limiting this phenomenon to the possible was like saying...
A Malsano attitude.
Something necessary sometimes, but to contain, and that's why?
In the year's course, we're from 1850, at the beginning of Novecento.
It's also the discipline of the tools to limit this phenomenon given that it probably causes the cause of all the problems of the world.
I'm born from science.
Urbanism.
What do you see here behind?
Something...
It's tremendous that, maybe you know, some time you've met, it's about bizzar tools: you're called a bizzar instrument, you have to do hundreds of practices, and then...
The pianification, the piano, that is, the idea that someone from the top can imagine.
The future of a city in the next 50 years.
Only he is in his head, or even for the last reason that you haven't met, everyone, but that I can even say.
And to pretend to imagine in a centimeter of the city what must happen in the future, here in a house.
Here's a job.
Here's a theater.
And then?
Let's also imagine the movies, the culture that is very exposed against the city.
It's famous a movie, a series of movies in the 80s, fuel in New York, fuel of Los Angeles.
Where do they Manhattan?
It was an uncontrollable island.
A city full of violence?
And of fear, so much to drop it.
And maybe because you've seen the film, remember.
It becomes a prison where all the world's senses are launched from the top and scanned for themselves.
The interesting thing about this process.
It's that, like all processes, this was also for the Italy a little bit far from 1845, it's about 20 years ago.
The sentence came.
"Yes."
The only thing in science, such a sentence, is a feeling of total solution.
Not only reading the motivations of this sentence.
It's discovered that the city is not the cause of everyone in the world, but even the growth of the population.
That one.
It's the solution.
To all the great questions that are affected by the human genius.
Democracy.
The investigation, the environmental sustainability.
Squality is the economic development, the creation of work.
The ability?
To create.
Knowledge.
In fact, this sentence also brings three.
Imports?
The elements that motivate this ability that the city.
To improve the world.
It's the density, you can see which my spices, my photo made from the top of my city.
The density, that is, how many more people, how many more activities, how much more imaginations can be in the same method, much more this positive effect is verified, and the second is diversity.
In other words, the fact that there are not only many things in a small place.
But that many things are different.
That there are rich people, people of all the countries in the world, people who love soccer, others that, like me, also ignore the name of the most famous soccer.
And the third element is creativity.
This is a white night, where thousands of people, for a beach, have a board, a series at home, food and stay together in a beach.
Creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
Let's do it!
Here's my idea: that the city, in the end, is solved, in some way, addressed as a solution.
It's actually a mechanism.
The definition of the city is no longer.
The greatness, the inhabitants, we are all used to confront this city for the inhabitants, for the bigness, for the product, no.
The city is a mechanism.
The city works, it solves.
The great questions of humanity?
Because it's like a black scenario.
A great mechanism that transforms.
Interesting different.
So many individuals that come from stories.
From regions that have different goals.
That if you take a trip together in a car, they would tackle it all day.
However, the city can easily transfer, magically, such individual interests in collective well-being, and so the definition of cities is no longer a static definition.
The city saves the world as much as it can generate this positive transformation mechanism, and so it's a city that can also lose its status.
Now we all know some cities in Italy, even big.
"Why?"
Maybe in this moment?
After a thousand years of history, these abilities have been temporary suspicious.
Wow, maybe!
Neglete, maybe never considered that, instead, at this moment, or for the previous ones?
They can be.
This is the mechanism.
And then we don't have to be afraid of the city.
We have to go from A.
Meccanisms and tools of contents of the urban phenomenon.
There are mechanisms and tools that accelerate development, and I'll give you two examples.
It's the work I've been conducting in these last years.
And they don't have fear.
It's the Cuban phenomenon.
But what?
Try it!
It feeds you this mechanism.
Spreading the big one.
With utopia and courage.
The first example.
It's from Milan.
And this is an image from the top of the city.
From the satellite.
And they are evident of some parks, not everyone.
A group of green, little known in the center of the city of 10 minutes of subway.
From the owner?
Who together?
And this is my idea.
And this is also the journey I've done.
For years with this map, I went to the city.
Liber is said.
It's a name.
This group of green, with courage, because it creates in the city.
Like the urban stage, bigger than the world, 72 km wide, a vital park that every day can be traveled, as I did.
And what?
Going, for example.
To see the maps of the city, you can imagine how the element of diversity and strength.
Creating!
In positive things, in the systems we live in.
Don't let us say.
Studying.
It gives the traffic retoric, which is still 9 cents.
It's before the feeling of solution, of cities like names.
To repeat the cement.
I don't know if you all have this one around you.
The second example is that.
From a city.
A few billion kilometers from here.
It's worked, it's called Buenos Aires.
In Argentina, the capital was placed, a few years ago.
What to do with this city in 2030 with all spaventurated: Buenos Aires, more than in other countries, is the magnet?
From all the nation, the place where everyone is looking for a possibility.
This mechanism, which is the definition of the city I've proposed to you, is in some way conceived.
Violence, poverty, also derivated from a bigger national crisis.
And what was the attempt?
Like Al solito?
That's it.
Limitating in the development.
And instead, it's with courage.
Speaking the big one, with the same.
The ability to believe in the power of this mental weapon, which are the cities?
Like with the habital park, even in the case of Buenos Aires, I proposed three strategies.
Three strategies?
Who welcomes the development?
And what do you see here?
A majority of anxiety, that is a great population.
A majority of infrastructure, "What?"
The creation of green spaces, you can see this map.
It's density.
The piano says, in 2030, we must not limit ourselves, but increase a million inhabitants in more in the city, build.
Stubbing!
With more basic careers, with more dense careers.
It's called...
The population not only in Argentina, but in the whole world, is creative to gather.
And then, building a infrastructure system.
Also!
I'm sure they allow...
It's even more in this development to accelerate it, and then, as I said.
Spaces of sociality.
What about the spaces?
Great and pedonal.
And this tragedy together.
They were put on the use of Buenos Aires.
Concious?
What cities?
I'm the solution to everyone to go to the world.
When?
Once again.
You'll see.
And Macáki.
Keeping the place on the end, look at the top.
This great invention of humanity.
What is the city?
You'll have a different feeling in the heart and you'll know how to answer that question that you've asked you many times.
And maybe?
You'll be proud.
To live in what I call the century of the cities.
Words are important.
They put us in a reaction.
It wasn't our thought.
The worst of our language.
I'm extraordinary.
These are vocational ones that are full of stories and emotions, they are waves.
They are evocative, they resonate with our story.
And beauty is our language.
And in fact, this beauty is tutorated, preserved, perceived.
Once again, I'll talk about it.
I'll talk about the missing way.
From the English, the province, motivated, often dark.
But the English Italian, which, for a few years.
It's starting to become common.
But did I take it a bit to the larvae?
And I'll start to show you.
Some lately reasons.
They have signs on their signs and the best universities in the world, and they show them with great pride: here we are in Australia, here we are a congress, and there's a Latin motto in Ghana, in Codia, in Duncia.
In Svetia, in the United King School of London, and in the UNICO, Oxford.
To Chicago, the United States.
Hardad says, "Veritas" in his teacher.
Not only university.
It's funny.
They will say, "If you're in Latin, eh!
London has a Latin motto.
Parigi has a Latin motto: "The Canada has a Latin motto."
The Kindland, in Australia, has a motorcycle, but not only: the American marine says, "If you've always heard it, in a thousand movies, the merit, the British girl talks in Latin, and even an institution, there's no grade to be a passatist, like NASA.
It gave a Latin motto to the Apollo emissions.
"Why am I doing so long with the Latin?"
And with the Latin motivations, because if there's a single place in the world, where a Latin motto could be there.
That's it.
That's it.
The cool!
From Latin.
"Yeah!"
Have you seen it?
Instead.
What is the mark, touristic recent of the Rome city, proven and raised by the human municipality?
That's it.
(Laughter) It's not even understood how we have to pronounce it: Rome, Milliw, Wow, Mendius, what is this low-pitched basis, what is this pollution, this circuit between two lights and sense, each one, what are the five palles in the top?
(Applause) And one asks.
But because, in the moment we look at all the markets of all the cities of the world, there's no one who does the unthinkable thing to store their name.
To promote yourself.
There's no leg.
Just dogma.
"But then you have your feet."
We want to give a call to the touristic power (Applause)
(Applause) Have you just launched the Minister of Benicuto: Very beautiful?
(Laughter) I don't like the aglophons, the curious thing is this: we're Italian and English in a very beautiful way.
Two Italian speakers, but we still talk about Italian, I mean, I'm talking about Italian, the most romantic language in the opposite world of Rolling mine.
I'm dying, the most dramatic language in the world, according to 120 linguists in this way.
The fourth most studied language in the world and not studies in the Italian to do things: the studio because they love it for the kitchen, for fashion, for the art, for the story, for Dante.
They study it for this.
We're talking.
We're talking about the language of the angels.
Second, you take nothing.
It doesn't happen.
For example.
The pizza.
It has achieved the world continuing to call us.
That's it.
So here you can see the map of pizzeria in the United States, confronted with the NEGO, with the quantity of the same map of businesses that sell hamburgers or Otdoxon, the pizza comes.
So, if the whole world eat.
And it says pizza.
Why do we here, in Italy, drink wine?
That's it.
Let's eat food, we drink waii in Lucca, there's noble in Cathedan, in Milan.
And the curious thing, because it's in New York.
(Laughter) If in the place of history they have to promote in the week of the Italian wine, they say, "Because New York's speakers."
Happy and elegant, who sell food and wine.
Do they say?
Dine.
Mom!
Let's talk about another Italian excellence.
Let's abandon food, let's talk about fashion.
This is what the greatest journalist wrote in fashion.
"Luccorri Frandly," the biggest, directly from the passengers of the International Flow.
(Laughter) Well, we understood that the stages are no longer the ones once.
Let's explain to you and I ask you what I'm talking about.
A T.T.
Donna Kurvy, as if it were a mountain road in Gran Canyon, (Laughter) and it wasn't beautiful.
How are we famous in our DNA?
And the women we see in our lives.
I'm sad of a scene.
Remember.
But if they don't go to the curves.
We want to talk about publicity, elderly, of advertising, this one.
It's the publicity payment of a novel in Spain and Pala, Spanish.
This is a publicity payment of beauty, of breastfeeding, of France and palm.
It's French.
This is the same page in Italy, and it's English.
(Laughter) There are two only Italian words: the first.
(Laughter) What's happening if, finally, the union?
(Laughter) We say, "Let's go to our radicies, we call ourselves, Landini, this: the union."
Reunion.
The radicies are the Italian.
We're sure, here's the curious thing, because beyond two Italians on two, we don't like a English word.
And 60% of 2012 we say that they're 58 so we don't know the English, we don't know it as a country, and we see it.
(Laughter) And here we'll wait for the medical skills of the gentleman who compiled this model of the island, they're superiores to linguistic skills, and yet, every day, for the prediction, for conformism, because we're modern, because we're self-vincial ones.
We use a quantity of English words, not necessary.
Not profoundly inserted in the Italian language, but also accessories and useless.
We say "cool" instead of the phone, we say "location," instead of the place, I've heard of the nitrogen and the location that was accepted for the seed of a pattern.
(Laughter) We say "compilation competition," we say "castomer" and "bigs."
In the ufficies, we can feel that we have to shout a scope of funds, unites in the case of satisfaction, (Laughter) with the united business.
(Laughter) When it would be enough to say, we must call a "fuck" and "gender" to put this seed of the client's services, because then the business unites is always "fuck" and "gender."
The English and the email don't only speak companies, but also the media, the public administration, the government.
(Laughter) We have a leg of the State called Jobsect, and I assure you that the fact that it's called Jobset doesn't make it easier.
And I forgot the Tesional players of Giobatt, which is a clothes that doesn't exist in nature, we would have done a bit of a house.
In English, there won't be more empathetic because there's a name in English.
That's it.
A couple of months ago, after the mark or tomorrow.
I thought I had to do something: to communicate my dress, I have in mind two, three tools that can be effective.
I thought, with the kids of my office, to put them in foot an initiative, and you say, "Ped!"
To make a minimal sensibilization on this problem.
Thank you.
And without spending a sun, simply putting us a little bit of communication and work.
It's a bit of energy, this appetition?
That invited me.
Public administrations, the government, the companies, the media, to say it in Italian.
And at the same time, in the first instance, the Aclusca Academy, because it was facing this sensibilization utopia, we were waiting for us.
A discourse, but not what happened.
In less than a month they've signed, putting names with men, I say, and there are 70,000 people.
They signed youths, elderly, Poly Gloppies and people who don't like English, have signed splenders and students, they signed Italian speakers in Italy, saying, "What's going to do in our language and they signed the whole world?"
The Singapore, the Jedus Jalemy, the Jud Africa's chest in Africa.
From Canada, from Australia, it's something like a movement: I've spent hours.
Look at these movies that grew, and they read the motivations.
And you can see someone here: the Italian is a right, but also a duty, we're in a firefighter, if we think correctly, we pay other changes, work in a public administration, help.
Film, because I've studied classic Liceo Classico, but I've worked with the economists, (Laughter) a great Italian and a decent English, I'll be better than an English scenario, Sisher, and we know we're talking about.
This is one of the most.
I'm stupid, I have a new plan, but I'm talking about the Italian, "Thank you, go to Rome."
First, because I started to lack science in our language, because I never wanted to say, I felt a year and a funeral that spends the occasion.
(Applause) Even for Dante, for Montal, for Caproni, for Paese, for Bianjarti, Bernata, I'm stubborn to feel relationships that don't know how to say "Boxon of the Table," but they fill the company's mouth, but that's how it happens.
I say, because I don't believe that those who say "cool" are cool.
(Laughter) Film, because I've heard professors, universities that say displayed, instead of visualizing.
I'm filming because I don't know the English.
(Laughter) First, because I decided to understand what politicians say who ask my vote.
And now that someone could finally take this initiative, I'm 85 years old.
Thank you very much.
That's it.
I'd say, an extraordinary echo to cross because in the means of mass communication they've traveled this thing, made of zero, you'll see.
They don't amplify it.
And this initiative is used in other 130 articles on the Italian journals, with a transversal and unimaginable consensus: they have spoken together grams and serves on the public stadium, but the reward, with great applause, even in Italy and the avenue.
My name is Wired.
And he spoke Friday.
He spoke to me about Christian family, he spoke to me about Turing's menchine, he spoke to me today that the virtual fact is a trial, a transversality.
"What?"
And it's all the real cost, it's also a bit of here, a little in it.
And that they went to the depth of the roofs, more than niches and colors, to the most popular ones.
And I'm a great desire to replicate ourselves with the desire and the consciousness of our language: these things are finished in the newspapers, I've also touched to put my food on the ship, and I've been interested in an Australian radio, as a lady.
That's it, you need it.
That's it.
And all this?
It's something that is born from the consciousness of each of us, because language is what we build at every moment of our talk, of our thinking, and of our writing every day.
So the hair is ...
Let's all have the Italian streams.
And do you remember?
In conclusion, some reason to do it: to operate the Italian words, it helps us understand from everyone, and it's a fact of democracy, because it's understood a fact of democracy.
They don't want us rules, they don't want us, they want us good examples.
And you have to ask the situations to give the good example.
Our language is everything: it's a value, it's a fact of your emotion, we have to sell it, spend it in the world, because it represents us, and know more crazy, we touch every doubt.
It's beautiful, it also protects the brain, more than a language, but who knows the language, uses one at the same time.
In English, besides all, we've seen it, it's easy to talk, and so those who speak, how they eat, speak better.
And then, the State took you all read.
In the first of the speakers of this day.
Leonardo who defined himself, "Homo Sanza Litter."
Because he wrote in return, in Italian.
It's always the structure, the way of science.
It's a Italian language.
It helps us express our creativity, if we renounce ourselves to express ourselves in our language.
(Laughter) We denounce, express one of the peculiarities.
Of the dishes there.
Delete.
"Manifique!"
Potenciality.
From our Italian creativity.
That's it, in your mother language.
And even if our linguistic tissue is solid, can we pick up some strangers of carity?
But we must take the dance to a tissue that is not broadcast and exhausted.
From sixth grade to an excess.
"Determinist, no, misunderstanding."
Why do I tell you this?
Because the Italian is us, the Italians.
With our identity, our radicies, our history.
Our opening to the world that goes through our words, thanks.
What does a young Karghiver mean?
When a person wants to start being bad, the attention is on that person, on their needs, but if that person, even something that doesn't go, is your mom or your dad.
What happens?
What happens to you if when I breastfeed, or in exchange, I started to get stuck if I still had a teenager, when I was a teenager I didn't have the idea of being a young woman in Karghiver, like everyone went to school, I asked them to smoke with friends, but what is there behind these photos?
That you don't see.
Before telling you the birth of the iceberg, I'd like to take a step back, I'd like to start...
Always from the beginning.
If I asked you what has changed, what's the same?
Probably, from the age, I'd say that I love the songs, and I've changed my girl, who you see at the center, to my adult, who are today, going through my teenager who sees the screen.
At some point, a tsunami has invested my family, a tsunami that has grown progressively, until it works, and when it affects one of the parents and all, even a child, a teenager, they are your points of reference, becomes really complicated.
And if I told you that the health problem?
Is it a mental disorder problem?
The affection for a child can be very heavy, and it can be made of sense of harp, love, hatred that are highly altered: fear, rage, sadness.
The difficulty to focus.
And also the duty to take care of the domestic facts, like making the spirit, or knocking to the freezes, are smaller lines, or talking to the doctors and managing therapy.
Or to be a victim of bullism, maybe because of the business behaviors, which your parents could have, but, in addition to this, you could have to manage their own emergencies, without anyone who had prepared them to do it.
But, in addition to all this?
To continue, also to make the life of always, to go to school, to study, I'm motivated for which I'm here today and that it's added another car, which is often not being able to talk to anyone.
If we say that your mom or your child, a problem of physical health, a tumour, another physical pathology, will hardly consider someone genetically committed and designed in automatic, to erase the same disorder.
But if you try to say that your mom or your dad have a higher depression, a bipolar scholarship, or if there's no DNA to describe their behavior and say, "Mom, dad, something that doesn't go, the answer of the external world will be completely different."
Even today, in the whole world, the physical health, the mental health, is not perceived as a common good, that belongs to all of us, and this brings a rhythm to understand what happens inside us and their love, urge to ask and receive help often not to receive a cure.
(Applause)
The climate that we perceive around you is the difficulty to communicate inside and then the family, the stigma, the prejudice, the shame, can they take you to have everything inside and not say exactly anything: How did I face the situation?
What comes out behind those photos that are not visible behind that smile?
There was a heart that came to form in automatic, behind which I was born, a ice cream that allowed me to have inside fear, rage and pain, to avoid that I brought people around me, that allowed me to keep doing the things of all my guests.
At the same time.
There was also a cry of help, a cry of help that couldn't be able to get out that nobody, even at school, imagined.
When the first crep started a journey to the first person in front of me, the story of other children, of other countries, thanks to the love for the lights that had given me with mental disorder, are all different, all unique, but there's one thing that helped me to open, and that we are still convinced to be the units.
But it's statistically impossible, in the world we're millions of people, and yet we're convinced that there's no other that we've lived the same things we've lived us, and you know why it happens because of our children's stories we don't talk.
Through the stories of children, activists, providers from Australia, the United States and Carada, I couldn't give a name to emotions I had tried and understand that they were natural to reaction to what I had lived, but I could also see the positive characteristics.
So I traveled my first intercontinent motto, that I found was a huge owner, and the desire that no child, teenager, young adults, could feel themselves, but also to meet these children, to talk to them, and it's a owner that I had strongly lived from their spices, because other meters.
As not rising, once again, to dedicate the weight of the world on my spices, and that's how we live today, in 2017, together with other Italian children, Gaia Carlo and Marco, we made the first Italian Association created by children, and it's called "PCome," "People from the Parence," "People with mental disorders."
And it's a project that came from the bottom, thanks to crowdfunding, thanks to the help of people next to me, some of them have believed in this same desire, they've given us the childhood to make it leave for their disorders, not even for their family, but also these kids we have to think, I've been one of them.
At first, when I thought about this project, another desire we have, and that's the point of another desire that we have, and the point of another desire that we have is to tell, during a walk, in ten minutes, the story, and now we were able to get to many regions, it's worth it, we don't want to reach all of them, and find so people from the Civil society that they didn't come from us.
To be able to see a wedding of the attacks, to face those that are the positive and negative emotions, the challenges of life, starting to take care of before it's too bad to save life.
It's a long and tortuous path, what we have in front of us.
It's done something I know.
It's that one of the positive characteristics that our parents with mental disorders we have is the will to change the state of scope, and that's why I know that the girl will make her desire, even thanks to you, we open the door together that for us wasn't open, we can enter the light, thanks.
And today I want to talk about a special person.
Aaron Sfarz, when they dedicated them to a documentary last year in 2014, they intitulated it by the Internet "onboy," the pupil of the Internet.
It's very difficult to put into precise categories, it was an activist, a programmer, a researcher, I'll surely judge a hacker in a good sense and an intellectual.
But it's easier to make a list for how much technology of projects he has collaborated, are dozens of dozens.
(Laughter) Aron, at 14 years old, was in the group that wrote the RSSS, maybe you don't say much, but it was Ubico in the sphere until ten years ago.
And to build, at 15 years, the "como" creative, dealing with the technical part, today the "commons" are about in a billion content, they are free licencies, they create the most flexible and open copyright, for example, the license of Wikipedia.
Airon, 20 years, becomes a small start-up to build something that co-founds something called reddit, becomes a millionaire, from one day to the other, but Aaron, honestly, didn't freeze the web, preserving earthbites, earthbites, Internet, which would have lost, are archives of digital memory.
KP: It becomes one of the protagonists of the fight against OPA, a valuable leg that a few years ago has built, even Wikipedia, to do Shopper, to go to Blockchain, because it would have limited the freedom of expression on the Internet.
AC: What Nareon absolutely harvests is an extraordinary, wonderful and fertile theory: all the wages from the economy to political theory, the history of education to computer science.
It was spinning with the capital of March under the arm at 16.
Audience: Yes.
Aaron and this tells us about her brother at a very tough moment of the documentary you absolutely have to see, and she had learned to learn prestigiously.
He told us his mother, who, at some point, was cooking, and aaron was two and a half years old, was seduced in Segelone and she had seen her on the fridge that she had just attacked her with her.
The warms.
But they discovered something important: this kind of knowledge has a spectrum, its owner, that is, the famous knowledge becomes a woman to share knowledge, because knowledge must be shared.
If we look at the aron projects, we see that they are all tools and technologies for access to information.
In the CIV Internet preserved memory, the RSSS allowed the blogs to synchronize themselves, the comfortable creativity are a copyright, so they make accessible to the people of content, the creative content.
(Applause)
The access to information is born from a very simple thing, but fundamental, as a bank, which is to give access to information to people, it means making a democratic act, our democracy literally is based on giving access to learning, to education, without this there is no democracy.
It's an act of empowerment, of ability to others.
And the fact that Aron came to this?
As a genius, this comes from its cultural land, which is the one of the hacker, the hacker as a constructor, not as a writer.
You know the code and you have the skills to read it, you can change it, you can make it yours, you can do what you want.
But to explain the world becomes a necessary condition to get the world, to make it unbearable, to be able to change it.
(Applause)
To make the world a better place presents.
A access to this information.
So if all institutions are social, they are made of people, so, fundamentally, they are culture, so they are fundamentally made of words.
This becomes unbearable when.
Do you know the code and know how it changes?
But this thing doesn't do it by itself.
If we make the world open, everyone can add it, make the world a little better, it doesn't become an act of eroism, but it becomes a act of collective construction.
Audience: Yes.
Nyle.
In 2011, Aaron is interested in this thing called Open Hazes.
A great movement for free access to scientific literature.
The world of scientific literature, maybe there's some universities in the room, is an absolutely chaotic and controversial world, contradictory.
They have the keys of power, making scarce what scarce is not.
That is, scientific information.
(Laughter)
It's passionate about the subject, it writes this thing called Open Higgery or Manifesto, written it among the other here in Italy.
The first sentences were power information.
(Applause)
Around scars dozens of thousands of articles, hundreds of thousands of articles from a academic Data, Gestor.
It's scholarship.
But the airbag had attended it.
It's not a genius attack, it's not surely not seen, it understands that its opportunity to make a Aaron.
An example.
They want to give an example condemn to show all the hackers out that the world doesn't change with a rich couple of code.
Audience: Yes.
"Yes."
It has been made of a real and its judgmental persecution, to have scared hundreds of thousands of articles from the academic and could do it, but not in such a scale, and it has been answered for 35 years, it spends millions of dolls in this legal cause.
And it's more or less equipped with a terrorist.
Two years later, the first rest.
Aaron was stuck at home, in New York, she was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it, that information is power.
And if I decide to be the engrance that holds the system, well, these will scholize you with all the combined force of the engrenage around you.
It's something we've already seen recently with Edward Snowden, Germany, Giulia Nassange, all different cases, pure similar, people who wanted to give access to information, for how much against it.
And I'd like to make you see now a minute, from the last year's interview, a few months before dying.
CB: I'm here to talk to you.
(English) Happy Feel your heart beat.
I'm so ugly!
It's also now all of you to get there.
I said, "I'm going to talk to you, now I'm going to talk to you about this."
(Laughter) That's great!
Hey, no!
If you don't have time to think about it, you'll have to write it on a barrier, you'll have to write it on your forehead, or you'll have it, you'll have to write it on the streets for "Craking Challenge" or "Say".
Let's go back to something.
The line is from the bottom, it's on the other side of the month, it's on the scale.
We're going to say that we're not going to do it.
They are exhausted: these mechanisms of winter and not the world.
You're a boss.
The last year, we started to think, "This is the good thing to have to be a businessman, but it's not just a writer."
There's a banal thing as fundamental.
There are two polarized perspectives of Internet: the Internet is horrible.
The mass sponsor is used to spare, to control, to oppress, but there's another fantastic Internet, free, a total place, freedom of expression, and in fact these things are...
The same: they're seeing in exchange, they're things that exist in the same way: they're too complex.
To be just one thing.
I said, "Yes."
It's an important thing: Zaptuas depends on us what will come from, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing.
And I wanted to finish ...
I don't compare my own because I don't have them, but with words of someone younger.
In doing living things, it's not something that will be: if there's one, it's what's already here, the hell we live every day, that we train together.
Two ways are to not suffer.
And the first one is easy for many: accept the hell and become part of it, until the point of not seeing it anymore.
The second risk requires attention and learning continues.
Trying and knowing who is what, in the midst of the hell, is not hell, and making it last and give them space.
Good afternoon everyone, then, in 1950, while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the mess of the osalamo lab, and I was improvised, I solved the look of the tattoo.
He asked.
where all of you are, and I didn't talk about other comments, I was thinking about the extraterrestrials.
It was crazy, no, I had done a reasoning: in our galaxy there are hundreds of billions of stars, most of them have 13 billion years, our sun, the Earth, four billion and a half years, well, if life was gone.
Because on Earth, we could resist, in the species, intelligent, incredibly more old than ours, incredibly more advanced from the technological point of view, with millions of years of advantages, maybe they would be already traveling between the stars.
But we've never been contacted by any kind of possibilities, some very fantastic answers, but the simplest thing is that there's no one out there, that we're all the ones.
So, it's possible this: I believe that this is a question that we've all done how many, first or later, in life, I, at least, do it forever, when I was a child, I looked at a stell sky.
I asked myself if, around those luminous dots, it could be planets, on those planets of living beings, that maybe at that moment, were looking at my direction if they were asking the same question, we were alone in the universe.
In our species, four centuries ago, Copernicana Revolution has told us that we are not physically at the center of the universe, there's a century and a half ago Charles Darwin has explained to us with all the other species of the planet, and in fact we're all from a single paragonable, and maybe even better, to other two.
This is one of the great novels of the astrophysics of the last 20 years, 20 years, 20 years ago, we could not go beyond our galaxy, we have at least one planet, so we still have many things to say that one of these planets is made of the atmosphere, so we can understand if, indeed, in fact, in the last few years, we will be able to study the study the light that we are, in the past few years, we can't suspect it.
I hope that we can all be testimonies in the arch of our lives of a moment of gender, because I really believe it would be an epocal change for all of us, one of the questions we could do is that we will never reach these other planets.
I'll give you an example, a concrete example: this probe, my spices and voice to Jeruno, the space vehicle built by humans that are farther from us, and the answer is not to prepare them.
From the Earth, I've been traveling for a quarantine of years, and I've arrived at the extreme confinements of the Solar System, and it's going from the Sun to a peaceful Space, 60,000 kilometers to now, 17 km away in our next centuries, in that direction, it would put us 74,000 years.
It's a longer time than any human civility existed on our planet.
We could do better in the future, of course, we could do better, but also the light that travels to the maximum speed designed in nature.
It implies "perts" in a sea of void space, and then, for me, there's one of the things to have present when it's trying to give more than four years to do this path, and the other stars are incredibly more far than that, but we are surely more relative to the question of female and the reception of a response.
A example of the Geomethi's office: the first forms of life, a cell phone, the ancestors, and the point of life of my hand on the ground, and today, four billion and a half of them, well, this is compassionate enough between the formation of our planet, the Earth, and today, four billion and a half of them.
The pulse of the right hand is the explosion of multcellular organisms, the most complex facts of a network of thousands of cells, the animals, the plants, the dinosaurs, appear here at the end of the palm of the right hand.
I said, "Yes."
At the beginning of the last speaker, a natural event, catastrophic, very likely, throughout this long history of life on Earth, even if it's calculated that 99% of the species has never lived on this planet are extinct.
So this gives us an idea of the fact that this long story, the path of the evolution of life on Earth, was a long-term path, and that I shouldn't necessarily bring to the origin of the most complex organisms, I didn't necessarily have to bring to the compassion of our homo sapiens.
In all this, where are we?
Great.
All the history of humanity?
It's in the tip of a wave.
We could completely can change the path with a lime.
And this has already happened, because today we know that for dozens of thousands of years on our planet have lived with us other human species that are no longer like Neanderthal.
So here, maybe, there's a bit the key to everything.
One day, as I hope, we will discover that there's another life in the universe, it's very likely that it's about microorganisms.
The first extraterrestrials could be simple bacteria, the fat could be dominated by microbians.
And intelligent species could be rarely, and even their existence could be beautiful, transcurable, regarding the times of life, and the times of the universe.
Maybe they are the same intelligent species, but once they reach a certain technological progress, they have to self-agree, or they simply impose, disappear, without leaving any trace in the universe.
The great cosmic silence that strikes us and encourages us, maybe a little, a kind of advertisement, maybe it's telling us something: life had to overcome?
A great number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we can have in front of us, in the future, after all, we think of ourselves, our species from far away, imagine us from another planet, if we disappear.
Sunday.
Probably, in the universe, no one would never realize that we were.
We think of a very young species, from just a century we started to fly, to communicate the radio, from a hundreds of years, we send waves in space, we arrived to the facts of the Solar System, but we just put the tip of the foot in this big ocean of the cosmos.
What surrounds us?
And I think that getting here would really be a little like a peculiar, and we, unlike dinosaurs, have, at least in part, the possibility of...
To change, to influence our destiny, we surely have the ability to move forward, to guarantee a long future in which to continue to discover wonderful things on the universe, maybe one day, life on some other planet, and maybe, in a very far future, to reach other stars.
If there are super-inteligences and galaxies, as you can see in science movies.
So, the only hope to be part of the club, of these galaxies, is to survive the longest possible, we have hard, and if we were alone in all this space.
Well, then I believe that even more we have.
The duty to maintain access so that we can use this wonderful weakness, part of the case, in a small planet, lost in the bubble of the cosmos, thank you.
The story I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not the sport made of victory.
But not the sport made by those who arrived before classifying, but the sport made and that generates positivity and positive things for others, a sport that probably...
Then you want you to give us the strength to move forward, the strength to believe.
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running, yes, because I run, I like to run, and here I was in Namibia, during the first stage of a long trip.
A trip made of 104 kilometers, which later became 100 seeds, including two, because 154 of us were not too few, no, in addition to two, because it's a number that will return, in more times, this story.
And here I am, at the end of these 160 kilometers, with everyone.
All of us?
The trip and the difficulty started, right now, from the first days, we were at the end of the map, and after six hours of trip, it was enough difficult, we arrived in the desert of mine, the oldest desert of the world for this kind of guys.
And here's another casuality, the petoral, the petoral that was taught to me, the number you still know, this is that makes me an important number, it's an important number for me.
(Audience) Yes!
This is the first stage, it's the first stage in our minds, but the desert is in general, and the race is a bit like the metaphor of life: no, you start doing things, then, during life, the imprevists happen, but if you want to take a challenge, a garage, you don't even know how to react.
There's always the possibility to react, and I had the first difficulty after three kilometers.
How many sunset!
(Making drum-like sounds) Would you like this?
(Laughter) In fact, that's how I said, "Well, I'm already there, I'm already supposed to be there."
In fact, I couldn't move, because in this area I was associated with an important initiative of Founderisinga, an important initiative to pick up funds for the fight against the stomach, a tumour, and a infant tumour that, unfortunately, affects many children, before these children.
Failing?
The desert started, and it taught me so much, it taught me that, many times, this was the beginning of the second stage, that is a little longer, in the desert of bruze, of bruze, of scores that we always have a gram, but it was a cover that started to wake up the security of the ground, the heat, which is the heat that there's in a desert, we feel unbearable.
And this folk was a wild paper, he was happy, because with the salt I don't know if you know it, it's profound, and when he runs to 15, 20 kilometers around you, maybe where he's going to eat, he's closed, but what does I do, I also do the medicine, he's happy for the cell phone?
Now we don't have to be happy, probably only for the savings, and just to be happy, of many other things, but it's also important, sometimes, to valuate well how we were fortunate, and so when you're there, we've done it in the top of the world, it's only six kilometers.
(Sigh) Now we're already at the kilometer 100 that also corresponds to the highest of the world here in Namibia and the sky did it.
Four kilometers, when I do other two, (Laughter) It's not normal, thanks to everyone who's giving you strength.
(Video) (English) (English) "Dad, we've never seen anything, but ...
And I found myself in the desert.
Also when this morning, if I talked about the small Prince of my poem, I found many people who shared it with me, if not other 26 people, because it wasn't a very happy woman, 96 - I was 96 people who have been running with me, and at the end, a magic is amazing.
As you can see, everyone is very agile, they also have the part because the rooms were a bit rigid.
So these are us because the organization that what had made a km away from the arrival had put that flag to give me the chance to get to the official area and then go back to do another kilometer to return back to 1006.
Because the project had the goal, I mean, to get to these people.
Andne, kilometers, is really inside, the number six, important and richer, the interesting thing that we've arrived at the end, and the collection of the 20th of the numbers that make 116 kilometers, or 2002.
But I wasn't like that, I wasn't like that, so I didn't have hope for all, I didn't worry, you can also run like that, maybe a little more, I had 40 kg in more.
I wasn't very sportsive, I smoked.
I was sometimes captained to the people to refuse, and surely I was 100 meters, and I was already doing this.
I wasn't just sorry.
Besides having a wife that's enough, I had two children, one of the biggest one, Riccardo, who's already been there for six years, and Pietro, who was six years old, and, obviously, had already understood: it's the situation, but unfortunately, life, sometimes, has resulted us in his feet.
AD: And a little.
Like the race.
What I mentioned before, at the end of the factory, sometimes you have to know how to react, unfortunately Pietro had a celebral hemorrhage, and this is the last time we saw it smiling.
(Laughter)
And that's it.
So, when?
But when did it look like?
When it seemed that everything went well.
He's 18, February.
In 2010, unfortunately, they called us and had an infarction because it was too broken, OK.
Gara was called Ranna,16 Pitro, you've understood the number 6.
(Audience) And then ...
And of course not.
Nothing.
In these moments, I don't want to give a broken impression.
You don't need to beaten.
It's my illusion.
(Applause) But I have to continue to keep going forward in life and give the possibility to the other two that have arrived, and it has come to Emma, and it has arrived at 29, June in San Pietro.
And I had to do what: to create or improve my life, to improve my way, not only from the point of view, we say so visual, but especially from then on.
From the physical point of view, to give the strength to people, and to be me stronger, and so I started to run the first image you see on the screen is my first marathon, at the queen, which was a beautiful one.
After arriving to the desert of Namibia, where I said these 16 kilometers' symbols brought me to win this medal, but to help many children, even if they needed it, and you can see them the magician, which I wanted to pick up 2200 euros.
It's 222 for two, because I haven't just run inside the desert, and I'll continue to run by myself.
This year, we'll go to the desert of humanity, we'll try to get to the end, but the desert is different, but the objective is always the meditation, that is to get to pick up the money to help children and help them to do better, the message, so that today is an important message.
Anyway, the difficulties we can have.
Great or small ones that are there, there's always a hope for everyone to do a lot of things and to move forward.
(Applause) Today we're here.
And today it's 176.
From 2017.
Three times, you know, you can see how you want to interpret it, thanks to all.
