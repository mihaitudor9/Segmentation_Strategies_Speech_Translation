In 2016, a award was my availability in the confrontations of the students and my ability to create less formal data supported by the Ministry of the United Nirland, from the name a little particular, they are born in Hero, we imagine that this is a great university class.
In usually, I go into class.
The first ten minutes, when the students enter and get there, put my computer to explain and put a classic music, I think this is the first step to create data environments less formal and more reassuring, and try to maintain the attention of the students.
But unfortunately, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a method used until the old age.
Storietelling.
At the pedagogical level, the storytelling is a method based on the use of narratives to transmit knowledge to students, and precisely with this method that I'd like to start by explaining you a topic about the mouth of all, already, artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that children tell, I'd like to start my story once.
A second world war.
1942, the UK, "Blece and Park."
A northern residence.
But there was a young and 30 years old.
Alan Turing.
Listen to Laureal King's College of Cambridge, and they get a research doctor in logic, the Princeton University in America.
In that period, the Tedes used a special and enigma machine.
It was like a writing machine, the operator digitalized details, but since stuck on a paper those letters, I stuck other letters, according to a code imposed mechanically under the machine.
The texts used this mechanism to communicate among them.
Anyone interacted this paper had in front of you a text without sense: it was written.
Alan Turing was one of the main painting figures in Blece Park, the one you can see behind, able to decipher these tests written by theedes.
For this invention, we think that war is finished with two years of anticipation, saving many human quickly.
In the adventure, continuously, after the war, to do its logical research.
And it's considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
That's it.
So, with your Turing machine, he formalizes the computer thing, even before the computer was created in practice.
In 1950, an article published on the "Mind" magazine, "Computing Machines and Intelligence."
(End of video) Where does the testing propose?
The question behind the testing is a very precise one.
They can think machines.
From here on, artificial intelligence began.
Probably many of you have seen the movie of the United States, the game of limitation, I want to explain to you.
Let's suppose there's a person who is digital to the computer, who asks, who asks questions, and on the other hand of the end, a machine M is an operator.
In an alternative way, the machine M and the speaker or form the answers to the person standing.
It's said that the machine takes over that Testituring if the person is not able to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the operator, this is the limitation game.
But the machine must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
It must interpret natural language, the question that comes from the person must represent knowledge to form the answers, to think in an automatic way to form these answers.
And it must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence: one of these is cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this process, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to capture thinking in the moment they are in, or we try to modify the thinking at a psychological level.
That's why artificial intelligence is said that if we can really have a female representation of human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of the laws of rational thinking, probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man?
All the men are mortal.
The Socrate is mortal.
This is a deductive argument.
It's trying to build educational arguments and make them a true conclusion: from here the logic is born, according to the approach of the laws of the thought, from here it's born in a car.
Another approach is the approach of rational agents.
A rational agent, an entity.
(Laughter) It must act.
It must be adapted to the context.
It must be carried out objectives, and know how to bring them to end, and it must act in a rational way.
So the Turing test is linked to intelligent people, reformulating the Turing phrase, a machine to think, we can say, "Can we create a machine?"
An artificial agent, able to think, exhibit intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence, so it's the purpose of creating artificial entities, intelligent, your phone is an entity.
Among the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence as psychological construct, once we have more knowledge.
In this thing, we try to build artificial identity and support humans, it's a cycle.
But let's see if machines can think, I'd like to explain to you to describe the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I'd like to use five classes to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We have subtle agents, parameters, some months ago, a boy decided to start the Rubik's cube, and he has rescued it in 4.73 seconds.
Do we have the sovereign people?
They act better than all people, for example in the game of the rocks, in the scalpy game, a few years ago the Russian Scake campaign was killed by an artificial agent.
We have people who suffer humans, those who manage almost like all people, for example in the Power Texano's game, to answer the question of the ketchu.
We have teeth for the mother.
And finally we have subtle agents that act almost like all people, for example in cognitive activities like the crowned words, or the classification of objects.
The recognition of caligraphy, the vocal recognition, the translation of a language to the other.
But if there's something that artificial agents, today, are not able to do, for example, is disambiguation: we're talking about the fruit, like the mum, or we're talking about the mark of the body Apple.
It's something that agents are not able to do, it's the region in the ideal world, in uncertainty situations.
Well, these are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence, for which we think we are far from overcoming the test.
Let's see now in the future.
They will be able to think.
A few years ago, in America, a thing was introduced by the name of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest experts in artificial intelligence in the world.
Imagine the time line.
Imagine a line that indicates the human intelligence ascending.
According to Ray Kurzweil in 2010, we had to be able to make use of this computer competition, for example, measured in the number of years and in four years, I didn't see anything: in 2020, we would have access to 1,000 dolls to this computer capacity.
In 2025, secondary and crossed, I'll never be able to rest in a precise way our brain, and finally in 2029.
And the machines will spend the test, they will overcome the test.
And then, in 2045, and the indication of the moment it will have the technological singularity.
In which machines will follow the intelligence of the machines will follow an exponential environment that will radically change human intelligence.
In his article, published on the "Mind" magazine, Turing didn't only proposed his test, but it also proposes new objections against artificial intelligence.
A few years ago, I was a student at the University of Varese, followed a course of ethical episode and ethics of computer science that came from the Gaithan professor, Aur√©lio Lanzerone, one of the compounds we had to develop was a decent formulated, with mathematical communication.
Let's take all this intelligence inside a machine, so we get an intelligence equation equation, and we transfer all these intelligences to all the people, to put the seed, a symbol of smell to the side of the equation, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were, to transfer our intelligence inside a machine?
And this becomes more intelligent than us, it's also true that we've left the machine to become more intelligent than us.
So to conclude my story.
And by getting rid of the initial question, the machines can think.
I'd like to leave you with an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you.
(Audience talking) Good afternoon.
How many of you today have taken pictures?
Thank you.
To find answers to these questions, I've tried to open a confrontation, with a photographer, a new method that has been placed in these three years, and that interests me to share with you, for example, are the creative directors of a study that takes care of photography, and in which way the photographer changes the future of their professionals.
On the other hand, the final goal of my photographic experiments, which, for example, has sustained the social sociologist's social photography, which has always been able to think that the Civil Profession City Council, which has been published in a few years, or in a few minutes, today's process, which we can be directly focused in the history of the history of the Fothotography of Fotography, in the Fotography, in the Fotography of Fotographic Fotography, in the Fotography, in the United Nations, in the United Nations, and in the United Nations, which we have been able to find a few years, which we have been able to be able to find a few years, in a few years, in a few years, a few years, a few years, a few years, a lot of social media, a few years, a few years, a few years, a few years, a few years, a few years, and a lot of social media, and a lot, and a lot of information that has been able,
Bred Mengin, who has used it for photography and exclusive development of photographic photographers, thinking about the circumstances of the circumstances in the south of the Afghanistan's South of the Profoundation, all this creates a vehicle of denounts, and has been designed by a new process of view of the world, which we can also be able to react to react to be able to react to be able to create a vastfeed in an interference in an interaction of the environmental level of the world with the same levels, which weaponicism, which we have been able to react to react to be able to react to react to react to be able to be able to react to react to react to be able to react to react to be able to react to react to the whole world, in order, and to react to react to react to react to the world, in order, in order, in order, in order, in order, in order, in order, in order, in order, in order, in order
And do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
What we believe is to be silence, in fact, are 50 parts of the electric race.
Fifty-thirds that are immediately entered in our lives, waking up from the illusion that silence exists.
"Oh, me, you don't exist, so also in this room, those protests, these smooths, and put a frequency of 50 ARS, then you're really stressful.
There's always her, eat with your partner, with your partner, except and then you'll have read in the bubble of your bed camera and think you're alone, but no more or less this sound.
That's it!
But we have a positive perspective: or better, first of the negative aspect, silence doesn't exist, but we have a positive aspect.
We're never alone, that is, this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us, really, paranoous.
And if we look at it as a drawing, this frequency of 50 Ears is nothing more than a sound wave, a wave is now with a beautiful rich spectrum, with which we can make music, and then I'm asked, "But why not make us music?"
So, I'm a composer of sound colonies, an artist, I'm now a little special, because I'm complicated life deciding to make music alone and exclusively through rumor.
My parents divorced when I was a child, and I know, you think this is the classic "Strappalacre" story, but in the solitude of those days, in the weight of the void of that house, I started to make music with all that surrounding you, with a lot of joy between the other of my mom, and I was looking at the streaming.
Thank you.
Of course, at some point I tried to become a normal person, trying to say, "Dad, why did I start studying Chitarra, piano, then I liked Woody Allen," so I started to stop Clarinetto, the problem I really liked Arenzo Arbur, who wrote a crazy song in Bigo, coming so the first years of study in Genoa.
I also dropped the clarine, just like that, to not go ...
I make the illusions of my classmates.
But why did I abandon all this because I studied and escaped from that notation so rigid, because there's more sponsors in a rumor, and I like to paragonate it to the problems of life?
So when I'm a child, it's to transform a failure, a rumor in music, and harmonize everything that's around me.
"Thank you."
I'd have been able, I say, "I'll make a beautiful turning point of doll, Ginopauli," and everything would be concluded, but no, I'm complicated in this way life.
But above all, what is sound, what is the sound, our internal eye, the protein of the oceans, our team, reach the maximum functionality around the fifth week of gesture.
So, "future Mum" I suggest you, and it's a richness that I make you personally pay attention to the musical choice: be ready, so, in a case, if the mom, during the pregnancy, listened to the British text, it's not a case, it should be ready, and this means that we start listening, for example, "Sex Pistols."
But what is sound: sound is everything we're surrounded, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what, in our lives, is completely abstract: all this is the column of our days, we don't see it, we don't touch it, but the colony is time of every day, the rhythm in our partner, the mother who screams us, because the mother screams us, still, and when we enter the assistance.
It's smaller than how I imagined them.
But smaller than what, there's smaller than the man of Milan, smaller than San Pietro, smaller than your house, maybe?
And you understand the same thing as when a person sees me in video, or on stage, and then I meet people and says to me, "I imagined higher, I'd also see, because it's more low, it would be really impossible, so, starting from this budget.
It's what allows us to imagine.
But sound, the study, is what allows us to dream.
Let's imagine our lives: I'd like to genuine your observation capacity, then it's a photo from the bottom, we don't do it, we're in vacation, we're in the sea, not in case, and then there's a soccer blog that talks about soccer, kilometers, kilometers don't know, I't know, but it's a lot of sensory, but a lot of soccer, a certain point, who has a certain point, who is, "food."
We photograph it, we look at it, we do so many videos, but we never stop listening.
We never stop listening, but not even a person we know, to listen, and I teach you a trick: when we fight with someone, the best moment to know the person is to stay in silence, that silence that, among the other, doesn't exist.
Like in this moment.
So, today I'd like to take you with me, I'd like to bring you with me.
Right to the world, after evolving your perception of listening, I decided to choose the dream of my life, the dream of my life that was born from the listening of myself, for the first time, the listening of myself, and I'd like to start by telling you a city on the screen.
So, at this moment, I was listening to myself, there was still a lot of fear: I had an idea, but I was the only artistic resident, and I started the most beautiful years of my life, for the simple fact that for the first time I was listening to myself, where, for 48 hours, I registered the sounds of the city, calling this project "Sound of Sound of Syria" and true, there was the Atlantis.
I want to sound, Shanghai.
(Video) Livox voice) (English) I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl, I'm a little alive.
(Video) (English) Hi, I'm a young man, I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl.
(Video) (English) Hi, I'm a kid, I'm a little girl.
Invisible, the air in the wind.
Wow!
Thank you very much.
Wow!
(Laughter)
That's it.
Chorus: Here.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
You were still focused on the visual, and this was a test, it's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test: you were all connected to the visual.
Now, there's a city that is sure, you've photographed, in every way, and you're asked more than once, but that smoke that is born in the tombs that are made, but the bridge of Brookly is an exceptional exilephon, completely in leg.
And I want to add it to it, between it.
I believe in the Counter that is really touched on the side and something important to say.
It's not magical because it's on the other hand, it's magical because under our eyes every day, beautiful, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because on the other side of the world, and maybe many of you know a pair of posts.
In this picture, in this picture, I knew Genova, I knew Genova, because I've been captured many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that, among my favorite cities, now, I scaven the applause, I'll tell you.
Thank you.
I started to record the first sounds, and the first sounds were given by these children, that in this tube of an important iron, gave me this Audio camp, and I make you feel, before the Greek camp, and then, that elaborated.
I said, "No.
Let's go to the span of...
Great.
And I like a poem - I've always done it - that I'm not normal, I've never been - I've attacked this beautiful, and it has restricted me a very low frequency that has become a synthesiser.
MM: Of course, Genova is Mordandis.
Well, it wasn't a battle, this serious thing, in every way the writing that you see constantly in a Ferrari beach, is not just a writer, for me it's a great musical tool, and it helped me to support the beat of this column sound, and it's more or less like that.
The last sound, after I really want to dream about Genova, is the one of all the boats in the port of Genova, and I found a sound of a track that gave me a particular frequency that became the melody, and so I created this microphone, I immersed it for 48 hours.
This is his orchestra.
And of course, now, I wanted to make you feel Genova, but I came to this point, "No.
Well, Genova as a sound.
Okay.
Now, do you feel this?
And do you feel this sound?
This is the sound of our passions, in my and your passions, and for how many people will tell you that they're rumorous, they're stuck outside time, you really want to listen to them, and I'll always bring you to listening, thank you!
As it's said Guybek in Italian, the word generally used is restitution, it's not perfect, but the idea of the idea, in generating the idea of restitution linked to monetary institution to beneficence.
A lot of times, instead, the restitution is linked to reproduce what you did, what you learned.
And going from the part of those who say, "It doesn't work anything," then in Italy it doesn't work anything in this country, we try it, so the next 18 minutes will share some point of this story.
(Laughter) From the end of the '90s, in 1999, precisely, this is my son's genius, at the 16th grade, and in the same year, my monkey organized the collection to pay the asylum material.
Very heavy, made with many parents, some of them said no, because we must help, we must think about the common state, but most of them made these extraordinary effort to help the asylum, to help the community, and it was one of the individuals in an extraordinary effort.
A few months later, we transferred the United States, this is similar, the same similar school for a close school, this is the biggest child.
And there's a completely different reality, that is what was extraordinary for us, we realize that it's a completely ordinary reality, that is, the issue of the game of restitution is very normal.
So the extraordinary effort of a magnitude of Italian parents, and ordinary for all this: this is the launch of the support of the famous Obama Cher, I know that there are also the mechanisms, there is fishing lucid, there are processes, it works, it's not based on this: it's a phenomenon and a positive circle, and then there are moments.
Trump is trying us very actively to ask ourselves if the system is given at the moment.
Obama has launched the famous bank, and there was an incredible technological debate.
These things don't happen only in Italy, they build a site that doesn't work for a few days, but then someone has stopped criticizing and it's enough to criticize that it's easy and normal to help that it's difficult to study, so it's not a common thing.
KA: This is Time Magazine's coverage, which refers to the experts of technologies sent by Google and other companies, they've been offered, and I agree with the Bianca house, they've rejected the session, they've been in a few weeks, at a decim of the costs.
After that, many of you would have criticized, but Google, surely, is their interests, it's what I want to explain from what was spinning, I'm spinning from people who haven't learned a lot about their lives, they have decided to reproduce the experiences that had filled their lives.
So, in this case?
That's it.
But they look at the ability to manage big technological systems, complex, unbearable, repeated processes.
And make them again replicable and unbearable, and it was a replicable system, which is the East Digital of this exercise, then a replicable system, what we hope to do with us.
But I want to talk about the word model, because one also implies the models, which are the models that are part of this bag, that we need to use, we want to reproduce.
For me, obviously, I played not only what we said until now, but also the Italy factor, almost 20 years ago, the idea of helping there was also because I'm Italian.
To do or not do, there's no attempt, maybe the Italian river is to do or not do, there's only to criticize.
A few years later, we're five to meet Mateorence without Francesco, and we've come to the Silicon Valley to make the necessary transformation in general, in which things get us disappointed a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of the processes and for the digital transformation of the public administration requires me, because it doesn't come to help us in Italy for a couple of years, I think, it's reflected in my wife's pavement, Monica, and I talk to my genius, to get the brief, I decided to apply and I didn't get it, or I don't get it, or I think, or I don't even try it.
The choice was made, and so it's been the Rome for two years in the middle of Amazon.
But those who have to do it, Mallia, Amazon, Probono, Maiday, something will give you underwater, these are only many phrases, and I have to say that we've also received so much support, so at this moment we're focusing on this part, but in a positive part there was.
I was mentally preparing for skepticism and bureaucracy, people ask me, "But do you expect these little bubbles, and yes, I didn't expect it, of course?"
But scientificism isn't often cynicism that characterizes a certain mentality, it will never make it, of course, because you have rights, I've heard a lot of this kind, and this country will never make it the sense of common good.
And to do things because you think you're helping to improve a situation not only because it's not interested.
And here's it, for the days of you, this is a commissioner, for the most elderly you recognize it, as a black commissioner, I say this because it's their rule that allowed me to be able to take people from the public administration.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is, as the systems from inside don't become, we want a small team to read 25 people, a large world, but it's also too small, technological experts, around 80 percent, and expert in making legal, governments, communication.
Here you can see the post I had done when, on the other hand, maybe some of you recognize it, that photography of the worst of the beautiful that in the '47s has ended all the United States, the children of the United States, in this massive sport, of investment of infrastructure.
We created the vision that the operative system of the country is a series of fundamental components that can build simpler services for citizens, the public administration and companies, a very beautiful vision of implementation: Lacrime and blood.
I continued in my place: soccer field in Salita, but that American soccer, if I don't make mistakes.
And I continued, we'll also have many rules complicated, sometimes incomprehensible, it's a easy prediction: we have to learn to manage with intelligence and bureaucracy, many of them will not understand how public administration works, they've already tried us in many, they've failed in Italy, it doesn't work like that.
And we'll continue, we'll get many criticisms: some comments will be useful, others will be cinemic and prejudices, the criticisms of the first type riding of people who want to really offer their contribution and we've found them a lot.
The second kind of color they want to defend the state of school is that they always see the bugs in the middle of the void, or that they simply have been drawn to the power, and this is our problem: to bring things that don't work.
Remember this image: first, men and women on the cover of Time Magazin, here is here, so, despite having tried to scare the most possible people to do with the eye, I received about seven people, and now we're a little more alive, and immediately started to operate, what do we do?
(Laughter) In fact, we take care of Draulica.
These are the tubes of the administration public, some of them to do a lot about connecting, because the big problem is that the systems, the applications, anything that should be interconnected, and asylum, don't connect.
And I'm not only talking about "machine-to-machine" and I'm not only talking about inter-perability connectivity, and sponsoring the code of publication: all these things are done in parallel, but without the tubes, you can't do it, by improving your own data and your own applications, so many hydraulic activities.
After a few months, in the midst of 2017 we wrote the piano "Trienna" to the Administration Transformation, we did together with the AGI of other people who helped us, what does something exist?
Two are written in a clear, technological way, but also in the process.
For the first time, it was assessed and sponsorized by the government, the triennal piano requires a game of square to simplify the public administration, the city of the citizen, particularity of the piano, once a year, because the pieces can't be created in Italy, in the public administration.
But then, we can't fly these things, but we can talk to the administrators, make the feedback happen, the documentary on the rhythm of Ox, in a way that public administrators and software can improve it.
Instead of dedicating this moment, particularly, and this is always a part of the piano to the digital platforms: digital payments, one, electronic positions, electronic letter, which is a habitant platform.
The greatest project we've followed is called the national and visual population agraphic, and I've been analyzing technologically all the data of your citizens, which are at this moment on 8,000 different levels, which are the 8,000 Italian, in the only Database, where data is talked about a common to the other, all those places, I have to say, all those things that I've already had to know it, then have to do so much about processes.
Two weeks ago, we made a series Akaton, which was made in 25 Italian cities, without Francesco, even though it's not Italian, but there are many Italians who are helping us from the technological point of view, as from the History.
Well, all this reflects - we're talking about sustainability and scalability in the sight of beautiful to sponsors of Italy, like T, where they're exposed, all the documentary, in all the codes, but they're always more, apps.
(Laughter) In the Italian publication, now there will be a fifth of what would be left, maybe even less.
The future is today, we dream a little, it was also working on other projects that normally don't limit themselves to do hydraulic, they also enter the boat.
But it's true that the paintings are completed, sorry, I insist, this can be, for example, one of those things that would add to the high-pitched entity to the digital entities, to the data of the electronic identity, to the data of the letter, to the public administration, we're dreaming a little, because we'll really do so much, but it should be in this vision.
A few weeks ago, the stadium, at the age of 150, wrote an uncertainty the world that expects us to ask many people to talk about what they think can happen, I was asked to talk about the life of all the days of the citizens, I took the opportunity to write an article, that I want to mention some fish.
It's a desire or dream, maybe we do it, we want a country where politicians who try to understand the digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rule and not the choice.
A country in which they read recognize and promote the right to innovate public companies, a country where there are more public companies and private, guided by 30 years than for 70 years.
Imagine, in the end, a country where working for public administration is an owner, where better brains make people work in public research centers, which are green and their centers of excellence and innovation that take development to the country.
But that's how a dream is.
But if it's not a dream about which digital, technological processes are really many, and maybe too many, and that the components to do all this politically can be done.
First of all, this is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Don't do it.
And here it serves somewhere in this theater, on this point, but it's more calm, and I couldn't explain what I'm doing.
(Audience) Yes.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the digital Tinder, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
Audience: Oh!
And if you want information about us, our site is our social networks.
And did you know the possibility to make a desire, just to change a aspect of your life that doesn't go as you would like?
So, what would you change?
You're afraid, you're looking at you, you're going to see that "yes" because here behind I know there's... So raise your hand those who would change their own body, maybe lose some kilos, or maybe win them in muscles.
I said, "Well, here there's already a little more freedom, raise your hand those who will change countlessly, better you can understand."
Of this, I was sure I would have taken it all, or maybe you're the ones who would change part of it.
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter) The more times, throughout my life, I asked myself this question: Let's understand if I won't change the part, and the answer was worth it because I would have a more united family, but my parents didn't separate.
In the media, I would have wanted to be better, for the pleasure of the youths, at the liceobre, I wanted to feel the most complicated teachers, they seemed to me all the hostiles, and I was reflected in music, here, the great voices to make in the living room.
I went to the University of three cards to play in front of a crisis, not only did they solve a beautiful thing, but I also brought my research to other people, and I realized that all the first part of my life I had been able to fight to try to understand how to change the things that didn't work well, but they were the only ones who were used in small doses and could also keep their problem.
The strategy, today, more broadcast, is to slow down.
We lie it a little bit of everything, there's crisis, there's no work that's traffic, that's cold, that I'd have done in a different way, we lie it because there's no justice, we know many people who fit in the bottom of the mouth.
I remember a girl, who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything else than dressed, from when the last work of the government that hadn't helped her, felt like a real value, ability, and now that she had completely colonized all her daily life, but lamented for all of us, helped her.
But, well, you can lament yourself at the roof, or in your mind, you can lament yourself at night or day, because we will all have many reasons to be able to lament ourselves.
But the truth is that for how much you will make you hardly remember something around you will change, elderly, you won't do anything else than giving more attention to what you say.
If the strategy that for the villages, when things don't go as you would like, is to slow down, presents that someone is at the study of a B piano to save the ball, in the mouth to the magnifying glass.
Another very objective strategy, when things are stretched, based on which we learned that if something doesn't work well, it's enough to change it, we can manipulate our pleasure, what surrounds us, we don't like the ship, but also the aesthetic rule.
(Laughter) You feel a little further, but why never be in the suffering, take two pillars and we solve it?
Your red wife, divorce.
It's too big to not register it, send it to the psychologist, we're here for this, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice is for this, this profession, to make the world happen to you all the risks of the palm with your demands, the context inside which this emerges in a very important way are the copy relationships.
I remember one, a copy, during the collapse of which I didn't do anything else than listening to what, according to one, the other would have to change to solve the resources of their future.
He said, "Yes."
It's true that you, to agree, but not even to prepare yourself in Chinese, which is also a classicone, and she, "No, if you don't realize all the things I do for you, you have to see all the problems that should be cured to reproduce our happiness that has been extracted us."
But the truth is that if this thing we often say it in a good ugly, believing us deeply, when things don't go as you want, that of imporing your need and expecting others to change them, because it will have a full of resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, is to make us feel like a tool to take the head and put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, there's the fear of facing the conflict that would emerge, that we should show our needs, and then what do we deal with them for the common good?
But in this way we don't even take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity, and we live in the merce of the needs of others.
I remember a young boy, young and young boy, a son of separated parents, who, at the end of the first childhood, had learned to get rid of the love of the other, in this limited situation.
I learned important things, for example, I learned.
To listen, to accept, to think about the motivations between them, even distant from each other, but on the other hand, they never learned to say no to the things they didn't go well, they didn't learn to tell their needs, their desires and ambitions, they were always undergoing their needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you, and instead of telling all of you, I'll end up failing.
And to wake up, to impose your needs or to suffocate them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say, with the means of cause, because I myself, throughout my life, has abused.
I'll tell you what happened to me.
If you like to continue the collapse with us, you must accept a transfer one day, the first of the hospital I collaborated, sent me to call and said to me, "But Zuck there, there's no place, and I'll tell myself a long place, you'll go there to make a job that didn't even enter a big deal with everything I had studied until then.
So I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, trying to make them change the idea, adopting, but sending that other, and even less because I'd never had to accept a commitment that for me was unbearable.
And there I realized that, to get different results, I had to do different things.
For the first time, of course, on my legs, at that moment, I realized that the secret to change the others.
It's changing oneself, if it were changed, the others would also be able to modify, change.
If I had become a super brilliant, competent, complete psychologist, the first one wouldn't send me to me, if I hadn't done it, the thing wouldn't have taken me more than that, but if I wasn't that person yet.
But the answer didn't go to the other's fault, but I had to introduce myself to the profound of my responsibilities.
Because things don't change.
We are the ones who change.
Thank you very much.
And the first change we have to do is in the direction of choosing ourselves, choosing you as a cause of things that are not like you.
You choose yourself as a cause of things that don't go as you want.
This is our bias.
But if I never find the work of the crisis, you're putting the only arts to your disposal.
Now we'll find ourselves alone and in a new language, if reading books, attending courses to acquire new skills, consolidate those who already have, you can work on you to become unique, because life is about those who don't do it.
And if inside the copy, things don't go well, you think it's the other to do the first step.
It's in this way that he creates a mental space before going to the research of his mankind, now he's looking for his needs, and then he's trying to operate, to be able to satisfy them, and he's moving away, and maybe his contributions, every day, this simple question, but don't change because you know what you're going to do.
If you're one of those people who are with everyone, who always have to say yes, one of those people I call, ask me in the end, prostitute and relationship.
It's clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose the sense of meaning the things you do when I've written to the university, I had a dream, but then the game becomes something inside their lives, the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to make them understand what you do, if, instead of understanding your needs, to understand what you're a person's inside their lives.
I had to lie to myself, or possible that I didn't tell you how much good psychology would have to change my dream, no, I had to learn to speak a language, which was the one that didn't happen, as close to the object, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to listen to their needs, instead of mine.
And, in a short time, following this direction?
I've got results for me, unimaginable.
And when I finished the collapse with my primary and its transfer, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I didn't know what to do.
I thought about it, and in the end I decided, I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as he understood him, I was transferred here.
I went back home, I got the computer, and I registered a video I carried on YouTube, in which I spoke about psychology, here for the cronach, I say, to take a few launch, because maybe you think it's.
In a short time, my YouTube channel was recognized that my attempt to innovate the profession and the way to communicate it had a sense thing: the dreams, something of Google, psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best schools, in Italy, and it's my review.
Because, fortunately, or because you've had one, the theory you have to have one is the one that keeps moving forward, who doesn't know how you build and needs to distrugle yourself, they don't become reality because the cube should do it.
It's also so much to discuss your identity, your points of belonging to your certainties, your habits of always, here.
If there's something I learned from all this inner journey.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but also the most urgent, ten motivations asked you a question: What would you change, we've talked about work, physical perspective, the current contact?
Well, in fact, I'd like to leave you with a gift, or at least to prove it, it's a small question that was personally very useful, and that is based on the logic that, to get to produce big changes, comes to focus on many small actions, which is the simplest thing.
Your life in the direction that is auspicious, you can think, which is the smallest and simplest thing you can do to put your life in the direction you live.
As you can see, I have the keys of the flow, I have to send you, I've been part of the pull, but where the packs are, "My markets are the tests, we'll close the open road."
Or on your feet, what's time to change?
Oh, you see, when my mother comes, do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to talk for eight minutes.
And that's it.
Well, I want to take this time by myself, here.
I had a dream.
To create a integration band, diversity and diversity, percussions are so fast, so immediate, they take the distances and unite the battles.
But we left.
We're lost in seven.
(Laughter) If you were young, I see them, and I see the Laura, the Paola, Daniele, I saw them grow, our proveers were the mark, the mark was the day of the test, where this stadium was entered in the school of Andreoli music.
And we picked up the first bidons, we were together, the first waves together.
Then we decided to become a good mark, from there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first satisfaction, the first encounters, the first satisfaction, for the kids, for us, for everything we were doing.
But above all, the first applause.
Unfortunately, a night of the 20th of 2012, the world was crossed, in the true sense of the word.
All the cases were completely unbearable or crossed: a strong earthquake scenario, taken our land, and from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of the thousands.
For all the inequalities, we were called this.
As I said, the houses were no longer agible, very crossed, our proof room, our place where there were all the marks of it was completely district.
And the tools were inside.
What did we do?
B.G: I, the Sahara, Marco, Fede, Matteo, we all looked for them.
But you have them in doppoli, in the aircraft.
We were able, fortunately we found them all.
We've finished all inside a trend, in a trend in the seventh of magnificent hands, we've seen fear sounding stronger, because the flag that treated to look for a smile, a look.
And the Earth was shaking.
Inside there, we built the first tools: the scary celebrities.
They became houses, tubes that became...
The tools built and suited with ping pong racks, to remove them made with big waves, crowned.
We were constantly working, always, there was an amazing energy.
Even if we were at a terrible moment.
The inside was born in our first protocol, so the group's components were increasing, the friends spent the 20 that we were, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
And we started with the construction of the first protocol: the white, because there were the smallest loops, the smallest loops and the white genius, at that moment, we all moved together as a brand of lights.
Then, immediately after, we did the year later, we did the other sponsorship, the swarm.
We became all marine.
Because we really wanted to navigate and move a moment to breathe for a moment, and then the year later we made a crack, this marine monster, immediately afterwards.
50 speakers, this flying ship.
And to finish, that of this year, the sea of the Moon, the sea of the Moon.
We wanted to close a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There were many things inside this tenderness, and none of us would never have thought that a tender could change life.
But we did it.
But I want to tell you something.
The minutes are finishing.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems to me a favola.
It's 150 concerts in turn for the adventure.
The first magician's stage?
The concert, in the TV program at home, is the lack of material, and we really did so many.
And also to me, being forbidden, because this is exactly me.
And it's exactly the scenery of life, the factory of the sweat, but also of freshness, that is so much possibility to the future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality?
Now I have to go back from the flows, they expect us to build, thanks to everything.
One, two, three.
(Applause) You, three.
Good afternoon.
And above all, our Italy, which is often so excited, is a country ready to incorporate this social innovation, in my name Maria Cristina Firradini, and in fact, was born as a lawyer, and at the moment I asked myself what happened in the last 250 years.
In fact, it wasn't just a surgery: the phone is a technological solution that belongs to the Industrial Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the Internet Revolution, and the phone, and then the vapor motor is not only a vapor motor, but it's a computer that has promoted, for example, the most speed that has entered in these 250 years, and has started to change the modality of manufacture.
We don't only need the motorcycle to vapor, we must, for example, the automobilistic industry: in fact, first, the Christmas industry has served when they were able to understand how to get out of the scent, in Italian investment, the motorbian motorcycle, and everything that has arrived, but not only.
In the Industrial Revolution, we are still followers, for example, for the phone: the phone is not only with the tool that allowed us to avoid continuing to see our letters from one part to the other of the world, always more than we knew.
But it's also what has allowed us and has taught us to deposit the caves on the sea.
And yes, because then it was the phone, we couldn't try it in the sea, and then what we were doing, we interrupted everything: no, we went forward, standing on the roads on the sea, the first cavity was there.
And we are around 1858.
But there's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know what it is, we use it, brings our voice, in 187900 subscribers to Rome, is only 1877.
Another intention is electrical energy, the first continental Center in Europe was built by Santa Radagonda, where there is the Renaissance, there, a time in 1873 was built in the first electric center.
In that year, on December 30th, the scarce was lit.
A part of our history was born from there, but in these 50 years of internal revolution, there were always more significant, always more structural, but it begins to be born something, to compose something that has never been in a stadium like this, and they had simply fasted the calculator, but in these 50 years they decided to open these laws.
And these challenges, which were called ARPA, ARPANET, are extremely captured, able to bring information, to give you an idea, in 1981 they were only 395 and they were 25 million, a horizontal system, not hierarchical, that we know, not many.
Today, it's in the orders of thousands, because we're not talking about the computers we use, but of all these intelligent systems that connect to the network, to care about data, to pick up data or to work for data.
When the mechanical strength began to include the replaced that was introduced by industrial revolution, the artificial intelligence of computers.
And mobility.
It's essentially an industrial process that tells us that what is a new progressively destroyed what is old because we've lived now, that we're living now, but this is the story of the great inventions, we've had the time we started to live in the time that we've lived now, that we're living now, try to accompany you.
It was 1863, when, little by little, the Italy hasn't made the Italians yet.
And the Minister Mingetti, put in English finances, establishes that the 27th of the Middle Ages, is corresponded to the payment and public dependents.
And from 27 months later, that this happens, at this moment, even if we don't realize it, we are introducing something extraordinary: first the wealth of a family, more than a singer, was in their ability to produce good services that were necessary to their own support.
With the security of the payment, the economic certainty to be able to produce good and services in the production of one, the denial.
But there's a second aspect, which is the fridge, and that it's not only the object that frees us from the emergency of going to spends every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to preserve, in a massic way, a healthy way, in quantities of food.
So, it gives us the possibility, once again, to focus on something that is not immediately the use of everyday life.
This is the man who begins to live to the speed of the challenges, the speed of the movements, the speed of our movement, the speed of our movement, and then there's a figure that has characterized these years, there's an element that we can easily define as the qualification of these years, in the time, as we said, has arrived the Internet, but we are very fast.
But until then something happened: typically, when you look at the story, to understand the passengers from one second to the other, and sharing data that are not necessarily zero.
In 1900, 1900, 2000, when we can say that it's finished the 20th century, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two data that are significantly segregated from an orbitrary time, from another one, 2001 because in the beginning.
So the American economy started to slow down, and on the other hand, there were Torri Gemelli, and so something in balance has started to change, these balances that seemed solid, we realized that they were very fragile.
But we went forward until we couldn't wait for the biggest economic crisis that, in fact, was verified in 2008 and it was crazy not to think about it, but what has changed, there was also the environment, there were European states that were to fail, the agriculture, already in the leaves of failure, and the world didn't even talk there, but how can we do everything?
With many less people.
What did these companies do, they didn't innovate inventing something, they didn't innovate by building something that before there was, but above all, they were not innovated, if we didn't know how to do what we've always done, buy, sell, learn, in a different way, in a more efficient way.
And the Italy, which is often denied, we are almost close to a connectivity connectivity, according to the human systems of digital systems, competences of curving it, of a different being, between advanced skills and basic skills, with what allow us to develop.
It's the inclusion of the system of public administration: we immediately have the field of some ambiguity, and we keep the beginning of two years ago, so we're growing fast, there are new competitors, new competitors, a fabric, so the commerce, a third fact that we must look at the elements, in a growth, completely in an at the end, until two years ago, and we're really a little.
In fact, a very profound change was born, not useful, not effective for the characteristics of our country: we have two engines that we have to look at with great attention that will be key for our future of countries, and they are the skills and the inclusion of the digital in the productive facts.
A internal segment, a internal segment that, for its nature, for its existential nature, thanks to an analog heritage patrimony, will be able to include the instrument that tourists, not only agile, are speeds in the production of products, are small, because these realities can become the richest and its cultural heritage of our country.
But if someone asks you, in the last seconds you, in the last 20 years, with a brush, let's say, in the 21st century, inequalities in the world, the inequalities, maybe, will reach the precious goal, are increased in a certain sense of the opposite of sharing, which would also be decreased.
I asked myself these questions in the last few years, and with the only 24th of the Foundation of video, I prepared with my friends a report on the inequalities from the majority of countries in the world.
And the result is what you see.
This is the curve of the development of inequality, in Italy, from the beginning of the second Republic, and in Italy, from the beginning of the second year, especially in the '80s and '90s, but in the last 20 years, we have a trend of decreasing inequality in the world.
And how can we read these data?
Well, a possible reading is to say that many of us, myself, weren't wrong the feeling, and it's true, surely in this reading, but we could also ask ourselves another question: do we find the idea of inequality in which we think?
Maybe we leave time in suspicious this question, and we move around a century, we must reflect on the concept of inequality, and we also understand a year before the great crisis of the 29th century: Lickens.
And he saw a problem for this, because the question that was asked Keynes, but with all this time, he knew a lot about me, he understood a week of 15 hours of work, he pronounced a speech in the first time, in fact, in the majority of the advanced society, we had a moment of economic productivity for our 928.
Apparently, this second teacher didn't realize it, we'll work much less, we'll work three hours a day, we're sure we'll all work and we don't all work, and it doesn't seem exactly what we work three hours a day, but in the first part we'll see that happened in Italy.
G.G: This one.
And the interesting thing is that this 16% of its life, naturally, potentially working, that is, for the 15 years, when we are curved, this trajectory represents the fraction of time dedicated to work in the course of our lives, and now we have already spilled it.
It's naturally...
If this happened, there are very positive reasons, and other banals, if you want, obvious and if you want to bank, for example, the oldest one is aligned, but there's a reason, perhaps, more than 25 or 30 years old, which is also a fundamental study for which our fourth of time.
So, dedicated to work and believed.
And it's the crop of the occupation rate, that is, the number of people who work.
(Laughter) This is the historical series of total occupation.
It's built for this occasion and this dramatic series, because it makes you see what?
And at the beginning of the century, in all monarchical era, before the Second World War, the occupation rate was even better than 70%.
Today, we're very low, we're around 50 percent scarce, since 1968, and around a year, the occupation rate has always been inferior to 50 percent, which means that they don't work, but not the people who work, that is, the purchasing consumers who don't perceive any network are more workers.
But, in front of this?
In fact, storal, we can also have a reaction.
But then we see if, in the country that the problem of modernity, that is in the United States, things have been in the same way, because if this interpretation is fair, it should have happened even in the United States, and then we see the confrontation between Italy.
And the United States: this is the storal series of time.
It's dedicated to work in life, as you can see, in the United States, it's only at the '30s, then it's established, and it's a lighter tendency to the increase while we grow, but even more impressive, and the storage series of the occupation rate, because here we see.
There's an increase, that small one you see below is the crisis of the 29th, but after the crisis of the 29th, we have a general tendency of the occupation rate in the United States at the increase, and in our case we have a situation of reduction of the occupation rate.
But then, this is a pathology.
But it's not normal, what?
There are more people who consume without producing than the people who produce.
But it's not normal that the majority of the population lives in a condition that I'll define.
"Dipendency parassitary," "dependence," because I depend on the network of Twisia - this one can also be a family or the State - but it's parassitary because I consume or the available network without working.
But I, a friend who does theater's act, when I found these results, we were in the scene and asked them.
You, how would you represent this situation with an image, a situation of parasitary dependence, and you know what has answered to me?
With the hypothesis, it's that light that lives on the spots of the hypothesis, but it's called buffag, some say buffaga, here it is.
If you want to have an idea of how the bubble or the bubble on the prototype, or on the other big mammals, these fish also live on the bridges, on the bubbles, well, we have this film that will treat us for a few seconds, in which you can see.
[A.DE.]
What about these fish?
How do they live?
This is the bubble that is contained in the bubble, it's not clear that there's this kind of unproductive consumer: if the bubble is contained in the bubble, it's not clear to live without working, on the resources, but naturally it's not enough to reach a qualification.
It could be defined by ignorant society, but it's a mass society.
Because consumers are more producers, because Greek Dubezon, a great anthropologist, would have defined it to a relationship of Open Legame, we see why, in society, it's simple, classic, we have the signs and the producers, it's much more complicated, the legacy.
KA: The relationship?
From bubble with the hypothesis and parasitism, and this is a advantage signed in green, but it's also dependence, because it depends on the food that is on the sphere of the body, which is indigenous a disadvantage.
Because we can't, we don't need bubble, but it's also from the point of view of producers, we have, again, a red fresh and green light, the autonomous hypothesis doesn't need bubble, but it's in some way, in a very complex report, and this is a situation of doppio-legama, but a situation.
That's not fine.
Is it a situation in which?
There's a new problem of inequality, and now we get to the question I had done talking about Keynes, but if inequality is access to work, we can use the tools of the analysis of inequality, that is to calculate a gym that has a job that has two jobs.
And the position of the History, in this scale of inequality of access to work and dramatic access to the best situation, the one of Norway, with the United States, in the middle.
They need us to become a normal country, seven million jobs positions.
As we arrived at this, this is the story of the inequality of access to work in Italy, always measured in any kind of genius, you can see something clamorous that inequality is the minimum, during the monarchical age, especially the second public, which is where we live in Italy, more or less in Italy.
But here I conclude.
But there's one.
And we have the scholarship to write in the first article of the Constitution, and we are the worst country together with the Tuesday of the West.
So, or we change things, and we create the seven million jobs that eat, or maybe it's better to shift the article one of the Constitution, and that being so things sound like a BEFA that works.
