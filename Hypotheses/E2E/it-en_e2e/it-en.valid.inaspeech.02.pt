In 2016, I was given a award: from the National Forum Forticing Learning, supported by the Ministry of the United States in Irlanda, from the name a little particular, they were born in Church.
KA: The motivation of this award was my availability in the confrontation of the students and my ability to create less formal, more reassuring environments, let's imagine that this is a big university class.
In class, the first ten minutes, when the students enter and get there.
I put my computer on the speaker and put a classic music, I think this is the first step to create less forming data environments and try to maintain the attention of the students.
Unfortunately, it's not always easy.
(Laughter) During my lessons, I use a method used at the end of the old age.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, the storytelling is a method based on the use of narratives to transmit knowledge to students, and just with this method that I'd like to start by explaining you a topic about everyone's mouth.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that children tell, I'd like to start my story.
There was once.
Second World War.
1942, UK.
Blockchain Park.
A ...
Resilience in northern London.
There was a young and 30 years old.
Alan Turing.
Let's see here in Cambridge's school.
And they get a research doctor in logical, at Princeton University, in America.
At that time, the Tedes used a machine.
Special.
Enigma.
It was like a writing machine.
The operator digitalized details, but old that stuck on a paper.
The texts used this mechanism to communicate between them.
But anyone would interceive this paper in front of you without any sense.
It was written.
Alan Turing.
It was one.
One of the main figures in Blockchain Park.
What's your team?
And I built them a car.
The one you can see.
In other words, in order to decipher.
This test is written by the Tedesque.
For this invention, we think that war is finished with two years of anticipation.
It's saving many human quickly.
Alan Turing continues, after the war, to do its logical research.
And it's considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
With your Turing machine, he formalizes the computer thing, even before the computer was created in practice.
In 1950, an article published on the "Mind magazine."
"Computing machine learning."
Where does the testing propose?
The question behind the testing is a very precise one.
They can think.
From here, artificial intelligence began.
Probably many of you have seen the movie of Emitation Game, the game of limitation, I want to explain to you.
(Laughter) Do we suppose there's a person here?
It's digital to the computer.
It asks that it puts questions, and on the other hand, a machine M.
It's an operator.
In an alternative way, the machine M and the October.
They make the answers to the person.
(Laughter) It's said that the machine takes over that Testituring if the person is not able to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the operator.
This is limiting a game.
The machine must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
It must interpret the natural language.
The question that comes from the person must represent knowledge to form the answers.
It must think in an automatic way to form these answers.
And it must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence.
One of these is the cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this process, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to capture thinking.
In the moment they are.
Or we try to modify the thinking at a psychological level.
That's why artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive neural sciences and psychology.
According to this approach, the assunction that if we can really have a female representation of human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of the laws of rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man?
All men are mortal.
Socrates are mortal.
This is a deductive argument.
Take two premises.
Let's see.
It's dedicated to a true conclusion: from here the logic is born, according to the approach of thinking laws.
It's trying to build educational arguments and get them into a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational agents.
A rational agent?
An entity.
(Laughter) It must act.
It must be adapted to the context.
It must take them goals, and know how to take them to end.
And it must act in a rational way.
So TestD Turing is linked to intelligent people, reformulating the Turing phrase, can a machine think.
We can say, "Can we create a machine?"
An artificial agent.
I'm able to think.
To exhibit intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence, so it's at the purpose of creating artificial entities, intelligent, your phone is an entity.
Among the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence as psychological construct.
Once we have more knowledge.
What about this?
What's the thing?
It's close to build artificial, intelligent identity and support of man, it's a cycle.
Thank you very much.
But let's see today.
If machines can think.
I'd like to explain to you to describe the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I'd like to use it.
Five classes to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We have subtle agents.
Stop human beings.
Sovereignity.
Superhuman.
Finally, we have optimal agents.
I want to explain to you with some examples: optimal agents are those who act better than all men and can't do better.
For example, people who used the cube of Rubik play with a four-year-old strength in the best way, play a sad, think that a few years ago a young man has rescued.
It was the beginning of the Rubik cube, it has resulted it in 4.73 seconds.
A few months ago, they created an agent, a robot that was able to solve in zero,63 seconds.
Do we have sub-human agents?
They act better than all people.
For example, it's a game of the rocks.
In the game of the scary.
A few years ago, the Russian Scakis camp was killed by an artificial agent.
We have the sovereign people, the ones that exist almost like all people, for example in the game of the little craft, to answer the question of the ketchu.
We have teeth for the mother.
Who act?
Almost like all people.
For example?
In cognitive activities, like the crowned words.
Or the classification of the image?
Finally, we have subtle people who manage the worst of all people, for example, are the case of objects.
The recognition of caligraphy, the vocal recognition, the translation of a language to the other.
But if there's something that artificial agents, today, are not able to do, for example, is disambiguation: we're talking about the result.
How?
The mum.
Are we talking?
From the Mark of Apple Corporation.
It's something that agents are not able to do, it's the region in the ideal world, in uncertainty situations.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence, for which we think we are far from overcoming the texture, we see now in the future.
They will be able to think.
A few years ago, in America, a thing was introduced by the name of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest experts in artificial intelligence in the world.
Imagine the time line.
Imagine a line.
That indicates the human intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a red line that indicates the machine intelligence with an exponential environment.
This is a blind moment.
Landing.
I've predicted in the Moore's law, for which computational compassion, for example, measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, radiated for two years and in four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to...
It's the use of this computer complexity to reduce human brain.
I don't need it.
In 2020 we would have access to 1,000 dolls to this computer capacity.
In 2025, according to the Kurzvale River, we will never be able to get rid of our brain in a precise way.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will spend the test, they will overcome the test.
And then?
In 2045, and the indication of the moment it will have the technological singularity.
In which machines will follow the intelligence of the machines and will follow an exponential environment that will radically change human intelligence.
In his article.
It's published on the mind magazine.
The tourists don't only proposed their test, but they also propose new objections against their same test.
These objections are us against artificial intelligence.
A few years ago?
Later, I left a few years ago, one of the compounds we had to move was to propose a decade against artificial intelligence, and the student at the University of Varese, followed a path of ethology and ethics of computer science, given by the Gaithan professor, Aur√©lio Lanzerone.
"What about human stupidity?"
It's the desire to describe in simple terminals, we suppose to take the intelligence of all people, to put the seed, the symbol of submission to the minister of the equation, and we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
So we get an intelligence equality, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were us?
To transfer our intelligence inside a machine.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we've left the machine to become more intelligent than us.
So to conclude my story.
Returning to the initial question, the machines can think.
I'd like to leave you.
With an open question.
That's it.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
How many of you today have taken pictures?
Thank you.
OK, well, this gives me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in the bathroom, and it all saves me the creative director of a study that takes care of photography, and it's a person who has taken so many photos with their phone, which doesn't do absolutely me in a photographer, I've spent the last three years.
This is me, immersed among my maps, to take care of a liquid matter: the photography, which is the product and broadcast through the cell phone.
Her limits, her contradictions, her potentialities, her impact on the market, her projectual and self-esteem, but there are many others, in which way the photographer changes the processes through which we communicate.
We can consider the photographer a new language, in order to influence theesthetics of the vision that forms of communication, the technical consciousness there is.
In the production of a scenario, from a professional photographer, there's still the difference regarding the simple gesture of primary and pulsing on a smartphone.
And how does photography change the forms and the structure of professional photography to find answers to these questions I tried to open a confrontation?
With photos, rescuers, criticisms, theories that deserve the photographer had a way to elaborate experiences and reflections.
The professional photographers, instead, that for the first ten years, have embraced the challenge of this new means, I asked them to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the successes, of their shared and images through the cell phone.
To find answers, I looked around me.
And I arrived in New York.
At the DSC of the photo editor of New York Times Magazing, in Cathy Ryan.
Is it Berlin?
In the AIM sede, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock.
In Parigi.
In the "Parifotto" room, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world.
To enter those places where photography is distributed, it's based on contents, and understand how the photographer changes these engratulations.
To find answers, I tried to look beyond.
In addition to the surface of the great common places, the visits of the contemporary.
For example, selfie, for example, the selfie to get involved, as some sociologists have written with the occupational bass of the generation of the millennials, or can't be seen as a health of segments.
It's like an identical stadium, like a overwhelming reappropriation of their own image, as it's joyfully reivindicated by visual artists, as "Kitard Ben".
Take a slow look.
The phyto-pintage aesthetics that has signed and still segregates our mobile vision.
This is my dog, Zazi, a victim designed by my photographic experiments, and it's simply the result of a world's world's world's worldwide, or, instead, as it has sustained the social, historical, personal and economic nature.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of answers, it's the territory of interpretations.
And from this phenomenon, I tried to give an interpretation in a book.
It's called "Revolution," I mean, for a story of the photographer, because in front of the excessant flow of images we are exposed, it seemed to me useful to try to draw a map, if not to find the route, at least to understand what we are.
And how are we?
The story of Mobile Photography is short, but in a few years I've invented millions and millions of people.
A new code that exceeds every linguistic barrier, used daily to communicate, testify themselves, to feed a constant flow of images that make individuals from an angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collective world, if you want, that has impressive numbers.
Every two minutes, today, we climb more images of how many Americans have taken in the burden of the year 20th century.
More than 350 million of these images are carried every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production, the diffusion of images, of activities that, until a few years ago, looked at a right search for professionals.
It became an instinct of action of our daily experience.
A form of social interaction.
A channel of proof of our private sphere in public dimension.
In which we define ourselves through the images we produce.
Or better.
We exist because we produce images.
And if the photographer is a new language, then it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that is still strongly signed by that structure, work, family, coppy, are always more fascinating, and here actors are unstable points in a universe in movement, sponsored in front of the media of the messages that affect them daily.
The flow of the photographer looks like the form of more natural expression.
A liquid vision that is composed of compounds.
It's constantly based on the instant gratification of our sharing need.
But in a world where each one, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone.
What's the professional photographer?
And what difference does it happen between accidental and conscious photographs?
On the one hand, the facility of using the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing professionals the universal language.
Fortunately, with the process of democratization of photography.
I started with Lera Kodak and arrived until the iPhone.
On the other hand.
The use of cell phone as a reward tool offered to professional photographers.
Nine possibilities in approach to stories, the contents, the subjects.
Now, on one hand.
The opening to everyone, to all of us, of a dialogue channel, with a potentially global audience, has moved the professional photographer of their exclusive void.
Like a producer of images.
It has put them in crisis the social function, the economic position.
We just need to think of the rule that had the photographer and social network in the first Arab Spring.
I'm showing you that being a powerful tool to orient public opinion and a capture of information machines, difficultly controlled by the kings, this is an image of threshold, dedicated to the rule of the photographer Mobile in the first Arabic.
On the other hand, right?
Let's think that the possibility of direct interaction through the web, through Instagram, between the photographer and the audience, has liberated the photographer from the obliged passage.
For the hands of the editor, the liberated by the need to undertake a political agenda, a editorial line detected by others, and not always based on journalistic priorities, I've liberated it from the impossibility to reach the destinations of their own message, if it has not through traditional channels, like sexy resources.
And he allowed them to put themselves directly in the user's shoes, traveling.
Would you keep visits in real time, an interesting example?
Like, for example, six female photos, an Instagram account based on a American photographer, Rayce, Kur Niss, dedicated to the conservation of the universal heritage of the family to the times of the photographer's memory that has had origin after this experiment.
Nine paths of curatory selection, like 14-1500 Bilfotographers, created by those Italian photographers, Giulio Napolitano and George Poswick, through a job of scavenging in the highest levels and narrative accounts around a topic.
But then are the photographs that in the last years have operated this tool with a great authority awareness?
I'm photos like Michael Cristophe Brown.
Benjamin Loui.
Orna Vib, who have used and use the smartphone of conflicts, showing how the agility and the description of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of deepness.
Photographic, Metero Coyaama, who, from a simple smartphone, has explored new paths for Newsmaking, creating a well-being platform to put in touch the American soldiers in the south of Afghanistan with their families and create a motor of information from the front of the first hand.
Bred Mengin, who used it for sport photography, exclusive territory of photographers with hyper-performant appearances, and made a beautiful narration of intimate narration on the best basis.
Research Cirnandt, who enjoyed discretion and manner for photography street, creating a very personalistic aesthetics.
I'll tell you that he made a small report, going back to the American community of Brooklyn, and creating a community waiting for the parts around his job.
It's a goal that uses it daily to build its family album, by putting a reflection on how Instagram changes the facts of our privacy, and the way we build and preserve our visual memory.
Peter of Campo, who, through the number of Africa, has shown how the photographer Mobile, far from limiting simply to generate visited cliches, could also be used to discuss the Western stereotypes on the crisis and the famine.
As they know about Luigi, who has interpreted the Omer's history with the cell phone, telling in the AI series of one of the oldest heritage of the West's history with the new vision tool.
Or like Anastasia Taylor Linde, who photographed the manifestants in Piazza, who, during the protests of Mai-Dan, with a beautiful poetic scholarship, and contemporary scholarship.
Well, what do these photographs know how to do?
To tell, going to the outskirts of action, or looking for personalized tags on the event, to avoid more than recording.
Creating images that are never straightened to reality, but that are born from a deep interaction between photographer and content to be broadcast on different platforms and reach different audiences.
To make network using the connections in an innovative way.
Putting on the authority exercise for their point of view on the world and the quality of deepness.
Because anyway, it's the tool that is represented.
Only if the conceptuality and smiled by a solitary writing, articulated in a poetry way.
It can be distinguished from the visible rumor of the bottom that offers us the eyes.
All of this, I believe.
It's still the difference between a photograph that deserves the real, its bullying, reproduction, its reference and sharing.
And a photograph that, for reality, can still be a cultural metaphor.
Thank you.
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
What we believe is silence.
Actually, there are 50 "erts" of black race.
There are 50 thirds that are immediately entered in our lives.
We wake up from the illusion that silence exists.
A email.
There is no.
So also in this room, those providers, these seeds, and put a 50-hern day, so you can imagine yourself, not, go home after a work day, really stressful.
Imagine your partner, your partner, and then you'll get into the bubble of your bed camera and think you're alone, but no.
There's always her.
This frequency of 50 Hers.
Because I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible, in our cases, in our lives, but it's more or less this sound.
We have a positive aspect, or better, first of the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist, but we have a positive aspect.
We are never alone, that is, this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Very good, paranoid.
And if we look at it as a drawing, this frequency of 50 Ears is nothing more than a sound wave, a wave with a beautiful rich spectrum, with which we can make music, and then I asked myself, "But why?
Why not make us music?
So, I'm a composer of sound colonies, an artist, I'm now a little special, because I've complicated life deciding to make music alone and exclusively through rumor.
And my parents?
They were divorcing when I was a child.
"Yes."
I know, you think this is the classic story in Strappa Lacre, but it was the revelation of my life, because it was in loneliness.
From those days, in the weight of the void of that house, I started to make music with everything I surrounded you, so ...
Each income complement was no longer.
A classic complement of network, we fermed, immobile, before the voice.
But it becomes my musical tool.
With a joy among the other of my mom, who every roof didn't find the bikes, among the other hand, Macciao, was looking at me from the streaming, and this is a great arrival.
Of course, I say, at some point...
I tried to become a normal person, I try to say.
I tried because I started studying Chitarra.
It's a strong piano.
Then I liked Woody Allen, so I started to create the grandson, the problem I really liked Arenzo Arvor, who wrote a beautiful song in Bigoa, was coming like the first years of study in Genova.
I also quit Clarinetto.
That's how it's good to not go.
It's easy to illusion my classmates.
But why did I abandon all this, why did I study and escape from that notation so rigid?
Because there's more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more sponsor in a rumor.
And I like to paragonate it.
To the problems of life.
All of us have attacked them.
A rumor, a failure, something that made us get rid of, but I'm sure that that that that rumor made us grow much more.
And a smile.
So, what is my mission?
When I'm a child, it's to transform a failure, a rumor in music.
And to harmonize everything around me.
I would have been able, right?
I'm going to make a beautiful turning point.
And everything would be concluded, but no, I was complicated in this way life.
What is it?
The sound.
But above all!
What is the study, and with the saying, is one of the most difficult senses to understand, but also the most immediate, the most powerful.
To transmit an emotion: our internal eye, the protein of the oceans, our team, reaches the maximum functionality around the fifth week of gesture.
This means that we start listening, even before talking, we start listening before seeing, and this is not a case.
Because the fact must be ready.
I know that the sponsor in life, once born, must be ready to the dark texture, it shouldn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So, in a case, if the mother, during the pregnancy, listened to Pancroco British, didn't worry if the child once was born, yes.
It will be listening, for example, Sex Pistols.
Mummy future, I'll tell you, and it's a richness that I personally pay attention to the musical choice: wait for the trap, more than the other, OK?
But what is sound?
"Yes."
The sound is that.
It's all that we're surrounded, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what, in our lives, is completely scared.
You don't see, you don't touch.
Like the sound colony of every day, the rhythm in our partner, the mother who screams us, because the mother writes us, still, always.
All of this is the sound colony of our days.
"Yes."
Of course, the visual is much easier.
We don't know.
The visual is when we enter the system's hair, we say.
It's smaller than how I imagined them.
More small, what?
It's a small man of Milan.
The smaller than San Pietro.
"Are you smaller at home?"
It's understood the same as when a person sees me in video, or on stage, and then I tell you about people and says to me.
I imagined higher, and of course, because it would be really impossible.
So?
Going from this budget, the visual ...
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's go!
To imagine our lives, I would like to genuine your ability to observe, so we are in vacation.
We're in the sea, not in case, and we start to...
I'm going to take the feet in the wise, then it's Lettino, then it's in another perspective, then it's taken from the bottom, it's not true, but I have a soccer blog that talks about soccer, kilometers, kilometers, I'm not in the opposite, but it's multifensorial, but it's a lot of soccer that had a certain point.
"I'm crazy, huh!"
No one eating doll.
We photograph it.
We look at it.
We make many videos.
But we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I teach you a trick: when do you get it with someone?
The best moment to know the person is to stay in silence, that silence that, among the other, doesn't exist: go for two.
To listen.
Let's stop?
To listen.
Like in this moment.
So, today I'd like to take you with me, I'd like to bring you with me.
It turns around the world, it was evolving.
Your perception of listening.
And I'd like to start by telling you.
The dream of my life, the dream of my life that is born.
From alcohol?
It's the last one.
It was 2013, I wanted to run away from the History for the first time, the listening of myself, a series of failures, problems and others.
Because then they turned into harmony, but I think I'm going to look for a very far place in Italy.
So, I decided to choose.
A city on the Atlantic.
There was the Atlantis, yes, it's true.
There was still a lot, there was one of the largest cities, culturally.
Artistically, and really far from me: Shanghai, decided to participate in a contest, I came to an artistic resident, and the most beautiful years of my life, for the simple fact that, for the first time, I was listening to myself.
So, I didn't have money, I had so much fear: I had an idea, but I was the only one to believe us, and it was the one that would have listened to the sounds of the whole world, of all the cities of the world, creating this project "Sound of City."
And the whole part, really, from the sound of the cities, the cities are a great musical tool to wake up this musical tool, you can enter the last of the cities.
And I'd like to take you to this moment to Shanghai, where?
For 48 hours, I'm not registered his purposes of the city.
And I created a sound colony.
So, at this moment?
I want to sound.
Shanghai.
You were still focused on the visual, and this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test: you've all stuck to the visual.
That's it.
There's a city that is certain, you've photographed in every way, and you're asked more than once, but that smoke that comes from the tombs that are made, but the bridge of Brooklyn can sound.
The bridge of Brookly is an executional.
Everything completely online.
And I want to add it to the other.
Or the Counter, who is really touched on the side, is something very important to say.
Mello.
Beautiful, but it's not beautiful because it's on the other side of the world.
It's not magical because it's on the other hand.
It's magical because under our eyes every day.
Maybe many of you...
They know a pair of places.
In this picture?
The sound rule is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, going around a city, losing yourself in the same city, well, I knew Genova.
I knew Genova because there were many times, there were absolutely captured many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that, among my favorite cities, now, scaven the applause, I'll tell you.
(Laughter) I started to record the first sounds.
And the first sounds were given to these children, in this tube.
I'm from Ferro, an old man, they gave me this camp.
And I'll make you feel, before the Greek camp, and then, that's worked.
But now, what's the lab?
That's not it.
Let's go to the aircraft.
(Audience talking) Great.
And I like a bit - I've always done it - that I'm not normal, I've never been - I've attacked this beautiful, and it has restricted me a very low frequency that has become a synthesiser.
His name is Ezzo.
I'm in the lab.
Of course, Genova is "Mor Zandis" (Laughter) He wasn't killed, this is a serious thing.
It has given a world.
The writing.
That you see constantly in the pity of Ferrari, it's not just a writer, for me it's a great musical tool, and it helped me to support the bit of this colony.
It's more or less like that.
So the last sound, after I really want to sound like Genova, is that of...
All the doors of the port.
That we are used to look at, but the sound is a perception that is opposed to the view, and so I created this microphone.
"No."
In March, for 48 hours.
In Genova's door, I found a sound of a track that gave me a particular frequency that became melody, and when it became the melody, it's because putting it in the loop is transformed in what the voice of the colony is.
This is its rock and roll.
It's true.
Well, now I'd like to make you feel good, go bad.
At this point, no.
Here's Genova as a sound.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
It's almost the sound of our passions, in my and your own, and for how many people will tell you they're rumorous, stuck.
It's really time, I always want to listen to it, and I invite you to hear it, thank you!
As it's said Guybek in Italian, the word usually uses restitution is not perfect, but it's not the idea, in general, the idea of restitution linked to monetary restitution to the benefit, many times, instead, the restitution is linked to restricting what you've done, what you've learned.
And passing from the end of the '90s, in 1999, precisely, this is the exercise of my son.
At the same time, my monkey organized the funds to pay the asylum material, it was an activity.
Very heavy, made with many parents.
But some of them said, "No, because we must help, we must think about the common state, but most of them were extraordinary efforts.
To help the asylum to help the community.
It has collected a million 200,000 readers, because they don't remember 600 euros, and it was one of the efforts of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later, we take the United States, this is now.
It's similar: the same scenario for a nearby school, and this is the biggest child.
And there's a completely different reality, which was extraordinary for us, we realize that it's a totally ordinary reality.
In other words, the thing of the game Beck of the restitution is very normal.
So the extraordinary effort of an Italian genital is ordinary for all that society, not that the American society is perfect.
So much.
I said, "This is the thing of restitution, I've had fortune, I rest, I help the school."
It helped the university, helped the museum, the the the the the the theater, there are all the communities, financially, live of fishing rejection, there are processes, it works, it's based on this.
I'm ten years old, some of you may have known it, this is the south's launch.
It has the support of the famous Obama Ker, who says, "System is the moment."
Tran is trying us a lot.
But actively, if you ask, "System is one of the moment."
Obama has launched the famous bank, and there was an incredible technological debate.
The technological launch has spilled 100 million dolls, so not worried about these things that didn't happen only in Italy: they build a sid that doesn't work.
There are so many million contacts, and this is the standard answer they receive, in short, beliefs that don't end for a few days, but then someone stopped criticizing, and it's enough to do, to criticize that it's easy and normal to help, that it's extraordinary for us, it's not a common thing.
This is Time Magazine's coverage.
Refigure the experts of technologies sent by Google and other companies, they were offered, and I agree with the white house, I didn't have the kitchen, I put it in the session, I stayed in a few weeks, at a decade of the costs, surely in their own interests.
What about it?
The extraordinary effort, and not the ordinary, I've seen that I've finished at the Time Magers' discovery, it's very interesting.
I want to explain what was spinning, I'm spinning by people, but still.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this validity, this bag, and they decided to reproduce the experiences that had filled their lives.
In this case?
They look at the ability to manage big technological systems, complex, unbearable processes.
Do you think it's regretible?
And make them, at the same time, unbearable.
It's creating a replicable system, which is the USA, from this effort, then was born.
A system replicates what we hope to do with us.
But I want to talk about the word model.
Because one also implies the models, the ones who have taught you the perseverance, the desire to never move, to continue to insist, energy, empathy.
So these models are part of this bag that we have to use, we want to reproduce.
For me, obviously, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also the factor of Italy.
Almost 20 years old from the History.
The idea of helping was also because I'm Italian.
"Yes."
I wanted to do it.
There's no way to find out.
To do or not do, there's no attempt, maybe the Italian thing is to do or not do, there's only to criticize.
A few years later, we're five to meet Mateorence without Francesco, and the Visicom Valli came to the sensibility of the general transformation, something that has discarded us a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of the processes and for the digital transformation of the public administration requires me, because it doesn't come to help us in Italy for a couple of years, I think, it's reflected in my wife's pavement, Monica, and I talk to my genius, to get the brief, I decided to apply and I didn't even get it, or I don't get it.
But the choice was made, and so it goes to the Rome for two years.
A congress.
Ah, Amazon!
But those who have to do it, Molina Amazon, Probono, Maiday, something will give you underwater, these are only many of the phrases, and I have to say that we've also received so much support, so at this moment we're focusing on this part, but there's a positive part, there's been, I was mentally prepared to the skepticism and to the bubble of people to ask me, but to wait for these bubbles, yes, I didn't wait, of course.
But the scientist should often tell you that he characterizes you a certain mentality, he will never do it, of course, because he has the rights, I've heard a lot of this kind.
This country, in fact, lacks a lot the sense of common good.
To do things because you think of helping, to improve a situation not only because it's not interested.
And here's it, for the days of you, this is a commissioner, for the most elderly you recognize it, as an extraordinary commission, and simply because it's their rule that allowed me to be able to take people from the public administration.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is, since the systems from inside don't transform, we want to try to transform them with people who come from outside, where the fact that they don't know the administration public is a asset, and they don't have a milk, it's a advantage, and they've read 25 people, a new world.
Not big, but it's also too small: technological experts around 80% are expected to do legal, legal, governative, communication.
Here you can see the post I had done when I just started this adventure, I said, "Why don't we write?
What I think will happen.
In this way, we want to attract talents, talents that you live in Italy, or that you want to return to what you see, even temporary, to a compensation, a very well-being problem, as you can see.
So I put myself in the idea, but how do I convince someone to do the same thing I'm doing here, for the other hand, maybe some of you recognize it, that photography of the mining of the beautiful, that in the '47s, all the United States, the United States, in this massive sport, of investment and infrastructure?
We created the vision.
The operative system of the country is a series of fundamental components that can build simpler services, effective for citizens, public administration and companies, through innovative digital products.
The very beautiful vision of the implementation is the blood and blood.
I continued in my place: soccer field in Salita, but that American soccer, if I don't make mistakes.
And I continued, we'll also have many rules complicated, sometimes incomprehensible, it's a easy prediction: we have to learn to manage with intelligence and bureaucracy, many of them will not understand how public administration works, they've already tried us in many, they've failed in Italy, it doesn't work like that.
And it continues.
Well, we'll get many criticisms: some comments will be useful, others will be cinemas and prejudices.
In other words, the criticisms of the first type will make people who really want to offer their contribution and they've found them a lot.
The second type of color they want to defend the state of the team is that they always see the bubble in the middle.
Or that, simplerly, the power is drawn.
And this is our problem: to teach things that don't work.
Remember this image: the first, men and women on the cover of Time Magazin.
That's it.
So, despite looking for the most possible people to do with the eye, I received about 3,000 questions, that at least a hundred decently qualified people, we used digital tours for the Colloqu, an app called Jazz, we have it in Jazz, we have it in the technological part, we've done a mathematical test, a little bit of the government, and we've immediately started to operate.
In fact, we take care of Draulica.
These are the tubes of the administration public, some of them to do a lot about connecting, because the big problem is that the systems, the applications, anything that should be interconnected, and asylum, don't connect.
(Audience) Yes!
And I'm not only talking about Washington Machim, I'm also talking about people who don't want to explore their own data, their own applications, so it's introduced to explain it, and in years, to implement it, to connectivity, to interruptability.
And sponsor the code of the public administration.
Now, I'm sorry, of course, to do so much activity of the project, so so much hydraulic activity.
But we can't also be pictures: to make the services of the beach, in time, you have to do them improving the interface of the tents, making them easier, all these things are done in parallel, but without the tubes, you can't do the chest.
Audience: Yes.
After a few months, in the midst of 2017 we wrote the piano, "Trienna," the Administration public, we did it together, to the ages of other people who helped us, what does something exist?
Two are written in a clear, technological way, but also in the process.
It was the first time.
It's assessed and sponsorized by the government, the Argentinian Parliament has affected the decrease of the present in the minister, the digital transformation is a priority of the government, the Triannal piano's life.
It's been newspaper once a year, because planes can't be static, especially in technology.
And it's appreciated to administrations.
But what is this, this is the only way to do the piano in Italy, in the public administration?
But, unfortunately, we can't fly these things, but we can talk to the administrators, the researchers, the technology of you understand it, it's regulating the technical rules and read probably three pains of view and connections to other norms in other rules, and at some point there are technological rules that are quite uncomfortable software.
To improve it.
We dedicate ourselves to this moment, particularly, and this is always a part of the piano to the agitating platforms, which are the digital platforms, they are those things that embrace all the activities of the public administration, the more there will be.
Digital payment is one: electronic cards, electronic letter, which is a habiting platform.
The major project we've followed is called the national and resilient population.
"Yes."
Let's put this, technologically, all the data of you, citizens, that at this moment are at 8,000 different styles, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, the only Data-Base, synchron.
Where data is talked about them, especially synchronized, and they talk to the rest of applications of the administration: when I'm transferred to a common to the other, I have to.
First of all, what I was managing, manually, then I have to go to the island, to the motorization, to all those places, I have to say, all those things I've already had to know.
We're solving the technological solution, then we'll do so much about processes.
Two weeks ago, we made a series Akaton.
where 800 software educators have worked on that brilliant application, they were used in 96 interventions.
Bagfixing, so, putting problems on software.
A improvement of documentary, and even to new projects: all this leads - we're talking about sustainability and scalability in the site of beautiful perspective for technological sponsors, like outside the History - was made in 25 Italian cities, without Francisco, even in Italian, but there are many Italian cities that are helping us.
For the Italian publication, now there will be a fifth of what would be left, maybe even less.
The future is today, we dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that normally don't limit themselves to do hydraulic, they also enter the boat.
But it's true that the paintings are completed, sorry, I insist, this can be, for example, one of those things that would grow the alsa version, the alpha, the digital citizenship has the phone.
Smartphone has the digital identity, has the data of electronic identity, has NPR.
It's already functional, and all this is the purpose of making it easier to familyize the interaction between the citizens and the public administration.
With the simple interaction.
We're dreaming a little, because of work we'll really do so much, but it's different from this vision.
A few weeks ago, the storm.
It's been around 150 years since the world was born.
They expect us a lot of people.
Talking about what you think can happen, I was asked to talk about simplification of the lives of every day of the citizens, I took the opportunity to write an article I want to mention to you.
Some fish?
It's a desire or dream, maybe we do it.
We want a country where politicians who try to understand the digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rule and not the exception.
In other words, a country where they read recognize and promote the right to innovate, to embrace it.
A country where technological skills are also inside the state and public companies.
A country where there are more public companies and private, guided by 30 years than 70 years.
Imagine, in the end, a country where working for public administration is a north, where better brains make people work in public research centers, which are green and their centers of excellence and innovation.
That they take development to the country, let's think it's a dream.
And that the components to do all this, digital, technological processes, are really many and maybe too much, but if it's not a dream about which to punish hardly, things can be done.
First to conclude.
This is my mom who belonged to the people who told me, "Who did you do it?"
(Audience) Yes!
But here it serves somewhere in this theater, at this point, it's more calm, and I've managed to explain what I'm doing.
Audience: Yes.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the digital Tinet, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
And if you want information about us, our site is our social, thank you.
And did you know the possibility to make a desire?
One only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't go as you'd like.
What would you change?
And what would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your genius, your own collaborators?
You're afraid, you're looking at you, it's for that "yes" because here behind you know there's... Then raise your hand those who would change something in your body, maybe lose some kilos, or maybe win them in muscles.
(Laughter) I was sure that I wouldn't have taken all of them, or maybe you're the ones who would change part of it.
(Laughter) More times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
Let's not understand if you'll change the part, and the answer would be because the elementary ones would have a more united family, but the doctors weren't separated.
Audience: Yes.
In the media, I would have wanted to be better, for the pleasure of the youths.
(Laughter) The university wanted to work, but I found myself with the difficulty of access to the job market: I made the university, I wanted to fight to try to understand how to change the things that didn't go well, from what the others thought about me, to the great economical hands, from the interpersonal relationships, to my characteristics and acquired me until the birth.
However, I looked at my research to other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
These strategies, if used in small doses, could also take some benefits, but if, as most of the cases happen, were the only three maps to play in front of a crisis, not only they didn't solve anything good, but they ended up maintaining their problem.
Audience: Yes.
The strategy, today, more broadcast, is to wake up, we know many people who fall in the bottom of the window, and the problem is that if it's mental space, this paralyzes you, it's not justice, we lie to the spot of eye.
I remember a girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything else than to get hurt, from when the last work of the government that hadn't helped her, felt like a true ability, and here was the mind that she had completely colonized her daily life.
In other words, unfortunately for all of us, it's a bit the great attempt.
Because with a small effort.
Then I had a great result: to review the void of the victim that was listened, comfortable, helped.
(Laughter) But beat.
Can you lament yourself at night or day?
Only or with friends: on the other hand, or in your mind, can you lament something that has already happened, or something that maybe a tomorrow could happen?
You can lament yourself at the roof, or as much more often happens, you can lament yourself in the right.
Because we all have many reasons to be able to grow.
But the truth is that for how much you will make you hardly remember something around you will change, elderly, you won't do anything else than giving more attention to what makes you say.
If the strategy that privileges, when things don't go as you want, is to slow down, presume that someone is at the study of a B piano to save the leg.
In the mouth to the magnifying glass, another very objective strategy, when things are stretched, is to impose our need.
(Laughter) At the base of this mentality, there's a growing cultural factor, based on which we learned that if something doesn't work well, it's enough to change it, can we manipulate our pleasure, what surrounds us, doesn't like us?
But from the aesthetic circle.
You feel a bit like this, but why never be in the suffering, take two pillars and resolve it easy?
His wife breaks, divorce.
At the fresh, we all agree how many risks to the palm.
"My son doesn't listen to you, Menalo."
It's too big to not breathe it, send it from the psychologist, we're here for this, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice is for this profession, to make the world around you get involved in perfection with your demands.
(Laughter) The environment inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way are the relationships of coppy.
I remember one, a copy, during the collapse of which I didn't do anything else than listening to what, according to one, the other would have to change to solve the resources of their future.
And he said, "Yes."
It's true that you're to agree, but not even to prepare yourself in Chinese, which is also a classicone, but she doesn't.
If you don't look for me if not for that, and you don't know, you don't realize all the things I do for you.
And she, "No, if you don't listen to me, otherwise you'll do another well to meet me, and so you'll see the infinity of a lovely iron that always begins with the same stretched word.
Because we have to show all the equation line of the other, we have to make them see all the problems that should be cured to reproduce our happiness that has kidnapped us.
(Laughter) But the truth is that if this thing we often say it in a good ugly, believing us deeply.
We can hardly change something, elderly.
Instead of choosing the node at the base of the relationship, we end up enriching them to heal them, if the strategy that privileges them.
When things don't go as you want, it's to impose your need and wait for others to modify the consequence, think about a pair of times, because I'll have a life...
It has resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, is to make us feel like a tool to take the head and put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, there's the fear of facing the conflict that would emerge, that we should show our needs, and then what do we deal with them for the common good?
But in this way we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity.
And we live in the market, we need others.
I remember a young man in the young man, a young man in the young man, a son of separated parents, who, at the end of the first childhood, had learned to distress with great diplomacy between the tips of mom and dad, often spinning from the fear of one, would have lost the love of the other.
In this limited situation, I learned important things, for example, I learned.
To listen, to accept, to think about the motivations between them, even distant from each other, but on the other hand, they never learned to say no to the things they didn't go well, they didn't learn to tell their desires and ambitions, they were always supposed to tell you how many.
It's the strategy that privileges, when things don't go like you're, is to suffer your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you, and instead of all of you, I'll end up failing.
To wake up, to impose your needs, or to suffocate them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say, with the means of cause, because I myself, throughout my life, have abused them, I tell them what happened to me.
One day, the primary of the hospital I collaborated sent me to call and said to me, "But Zuckeli, here for her, there's no more place, you have to continue the collapse with us, you have to accept a transfer."
And he told me a far away place, lost, detesitated from the most, or, above all, he would be able to go there to make a job that didn't even enter a big deal with everything I had studied until then.
I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, trying to make them change the idea, adopting, but sending that other, and even less because I'd never had to accept a commitment that was unbearable for me.
Then I understood that...
But having different results would have had to do different things.
For the first time, of course, on my legs, at that moment, I realized that the secret to change the others.
It's changing yourself.
And if it was changed me?
The others would also be able to follow, modify, change.
If I had become a super brilliant, competent, complete psychologist, the first one wouldn't send me via, if I hadn't done it, the thing wouldn't have taken me more than the Limica Chias.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
But the answer didn't go to the other's fault, but I had to introduce myself to the profound of my own.
Responsability.
But why things?
They don't change.
We are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do?
It's in the direction of choosing us.
And you choose.
How does things cause?
That they don't go like you want.
You choose yourself as a cause of things that don't go as you want.
This is our bubble.
But if I never find the work of the crisis, you're putting the only arts to your disposal.
Now we'll find ourselves alone and in a new language, if reading books, attending courses to acquire new skills, consolidate those who already have, you can work on you to become unique.
But why is life of those who do it?
Who doesn't do it?
He suffers it.
(Laughter) If it's inside the copy, things don't go well, you think it's the other to do the first step.
You're sending them a message of inadequality, and you're going away, if you're part of you.
And maybe your own contributions, every day, this simple question.
So, what can I do today differently?
To make your best newspaper.
And then things change, but they don't change, but they change because you are you who have changed before going to the research of their lacks.
Now she's looking for her needs.
And then I try to operate to be able to satisfy them.
And in this way, I create a mental space inside which we can take care of one another instead of making the war.
I don't know if you're one of those people.
It's clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose the sense of meaning, the things you do.
If you start to yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand which actions you put in the field to preserve them, then the game becomes something inside which you can become the pattern of the table.
It's starting to work on me, considering myself a cause of the things that didn't go as I wanted, instead of their simple effect that I also started to have to be a better person.
When I was writing to the university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to understand them that, with my matter, there were practical tools, sometimes even fast to bring great value inside their lives.
But friends, I met with a couple of...
Of problems.
Stereotypes, prejudices, psychologist is the doctor of the matters, the psychologist is the doctor of the debts, but I had to talk to a friend, but I went to the park, but what should I do?
I had to lament myself, or possible that I didn't tell you how beautiful psychology I had to try to change their mental priority, I had to abandon my dream: no, I had to.
To learn to speak a language, which was the one that didn't happen, as the agent closer, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to learn to listen to their needs.
Instead of imposing my thing.
It's the turn of...
A little time, following this direction, I got results for me unimaginable.
When I finished my primary school and his transfer, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I didn't know what to do.
I thought about it, and finally I decided.
I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as he understood him.
I'm transferred here.
I went home, I killed the computer, and I registered a video I carried on YouTube.
In which I spoke about psychology, here for the chronologist I'll say I'll take a few launch, because maybe you think...
In a short time, my YouTube channel has become a reference point in Italy for what psychologists look at in video thanks to this thing every day thousands of people are approaching the psychology putting in discussions some of the stereotypes I mentioned before.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm in 79: I share psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best schools in Italy, and I left my review.
I had to let myself down.
Because, obviously, they saw that my attempt to innovate the profession in a way to communicate it had something sense, and in Lombardia I was read to the president's vice-president.
The dreams.
They don't become reality, why?
For example, fortunately, or because you've had that.
The theory that you have to have is the one that keeps moving forward, who doesn't know how you build and needs to distrugle yourself, because the culprit should do it.
It's also so much to discuss your identity, your points of belonging to your certainties, your habits of always.
So, if there's something I learned from all this inner journey.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but also the most urgent.
It must come to our internal.
Ten minutes ago I asked you a question: if I had the chance to express a desire, one only to modify a aspect of your life that doesn't go as a forest?
What would you change, have we talked about work, physical perspective, of the current story?
(Laughter) Well, in fact, I'd like to leave you with a gift, at least to prove, it's a small question that was personally very useful, and that is based on the logic that, to get to produce big changes, comes to focus on many small actions.
But what's the smallest thing?
And more simple.
That you could do until now, until the end of the afternoon, to return home after this beautiful day, and that will allow you to take the first step.
To put ...
Your life in the direction?
That's where you auspicize.
You can think, what is the smallest, the simplest thing you can do to put your life in the direction you live in.
"Dad."
"I have your keys of the fridge, I have to eat."
Or, ugly, do you leave the pull, right?
BB: Fede, but where do you put the bags?
Fairy, markets are the prove.
Obviously, now I call you.
Or your ugly, what's time to change?
I did it when my mother arrived.
But do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to talk for eight minutes.
And me, this?
I want to take this time by myself, here.
I had a dream.
To create a integration band.
A lot of diversity and diversity.
The percussions are so fast, so immediate, they take the distances and unite the battles.
Are we leaving?
We are part of seven.
You're young, I see them, I see Laura, Paola.
I saw them grow.
And our tests were the marketing.
The Friday was the day of evidence, where this stadium was entered in the Music of Andreoli.
So we picked up the first bidons, we were together, the first waves together.
Then we decided to become a good mark.
From that moment on, we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical brands and travels: the first brands, the first brands in the pieces, the first satisfaction, the first encounters.
The first satisfaction for the kids, for us, for everything we were doing.
But above all, the first applause.
Unfortunately...
One night of the 20th of 2012, the world fell down.
In the real sense of the word.
All the cases were completely unbearable or crowned: a strong earthquake scope made our earths.
And from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of the thousands.
For all the inequalities, we were called this.
As I said, the houses were...
Not more agible.
Many crossed: our proof room, our place where there were all the marks and it was completely district.
The tools were inside.
What did we do?
I, the Sahara, Marco, Fede, Matteo, we all looked for them.
You have them in doppoli and the roads.
We were able.
Luckily, we found them all.
We've finished all of us inside a tender, in a tender, in the thirst of manifesto, in the end of the media, inside that tender.
There are magnificent things.
We've seen fear sounding stronger.
Because the bathroom of the bathroom sounds stronger than the earthquake: we looked at ourselves in the eyes.
The Earth that was shaking to look for a smile.
A look.
The Earth was shaking.
Is it there?
We built the first tools.
The scary cests.
They became houses in the bank.
From the tubes that became...
The tools built and suited with ping pong racks, to remove made with big houses, crowned.
We were constantly.
In continuous work, always, there was an amazing energy.
Although we were at a terrible moment.
Audience: Yes.
The inside was born in our first protocol.
We decided to put on a real sponsor.
However, the group's components were increasing, the friends spent the word of 20 that we were, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We are part of the construction of the first protocol: the white.
Because it's the white man, because there were the smallest loops, the biggest loops, and the white genius.
At that moment, we all moved together.
Like a blank of lights.
Then, immediately after.
What did we do?
Last year, we did the high school, the swarm.
We became all marine.
Because we really wanted to navigate.
And to move a moment to our Earth.
To breathe for a moment.
Then the year later we made a crack, this marine monster, immediately after.
50 speakers, this flywheel.
And to conclude, that of this year, the sea of the Moon.
The sea of the Moon.
We wanted to close a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There are many things inside this tenderness.
And none of us would never have thought that it's a tender?
We could change life, but we did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
The minutes are finishing.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems to me a favola.
Audience: Yes.
150 concerts in turn for the History.
The first magician's stage?
The concert in the TV program at home.
It's the lack of material.
And we really did many.
And also to me, leaving the reals, because this is exactly me.
It's exactly the scenery of life.
The fatigue of the sweat, but also.
From the forest, which is so much possibility to the future.
So, what happens when a dream?
To become reality.
Now I have to go back from the fruits, they expect me.
Is there still so much?
And to build.
Thank you all.
(Applause) One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Firadini, and in fact I was born as a lawyer, until the moment I asked myself what happened in the last 250 years.
250, very important years that changed radically our history, and that we live today, we talk about social innovation, and my question is: What is this social innovation?
And above all, our Italy, which is often so biased, is a ready country to incorporate this digital innovation and ready to be tested at the same time of innovation.
Nevertheless, these three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new time, that we have, in some way, historically battled arbitrally in the 2000s, this is the internal revolution that we are living today.
So we try to understand then what happened in these three, in these 250 years, that reassure the industrial revolution, the Internet revolution and the Internet soldiers.
What did we study?
In school, in fact, it wasn't just a philosophy: we, at the industrial revolution, are huge debates, are normally debates, for example, because we need the motorcycle to vapor.
And the vapor motorcycle isn't just a vapor motorcycle, but, for example, that tool that has favored and has become faster, the carbon station, and the network is possible to a more effective cost, and it has started to change the modality, but it doesn't make it happen.
But we don't only have the motorcycle.
The vapor, we also need the scope motorcycle, because, on the other hand, it's an Italian invention, the motor is broken.
For example, we need the automobilistic industry.
In fact, before the Christmas industry, because the motorcycle was a motorcycle that couldn't leave the farm, when they were able to understand how to make that scent, to realize it as a verb, and it became with the scent that has developed the automobilist industry, and everything that has happened to us.
But I'm not.
In the Industrial Revolution, we are still in debates, for example, for the phone, the phone is not only with the tool that allowed us to avoid continuing to see our letters from one part to the other, always more broader than we knew.
But it's also what has allowed us, and has taught us to deposit the caves.
Sout the sea.
And yes, because then it was the phone, we couldn't try it in the sea, and then what did we do?
We interrupted everything.
No, if we went forward, standing on the sea, the first cavity, to give you a storal dimension, was taken from Italy between medicine and registered the beach, not just two populations that came from agreement, but the first cavity was there.
And we are around 1858.
But there's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know what it is, we use it, brings it to our voice, in 187900 subscribed to Rome.
It's only 1877.
Another invention is electrical energy: the first continental power central power in Europe was built by Santa Radagonda, where there is the Milan Rinascente.
Today, the teenager is there, a time in 1873 was built the first electric center.
In that year, on December 30th, the scale was lit.
A part of our history was born exactly there.
Let's move forward, let's try to do some things that are still in the course, but that has already lived important, and also important emotions from the cultural artistic point of view, but it begins to be something, to compose something that has never been in the story before: between the computer that has simply been faster, the calculator.
But they went forward and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors, they started to be the artificial intelligences we know.
But in these 50 years of the Internet revolution, something else happened, there were research institutions, and above all, there were scopes of all the defenses that have led to develop subterraneous reactions, but not underground because they were not known, but at some point they decided to open these reactions.
And these challenges, called ARPA, the network, became and started to be the World of Web that we know.
A diffused, or horizontal system, not hierarchical, extremely captured, capable of bringing information, in 1981 they were only 300 the computer connected to the Internet, in 1995 and they were 25 million.
Not many.
Today, it's in the order of the dozens of billion, because we're not talking about the computers we use, but of all these intelligent systems that connect to the network to caricate data, to pick up data or to work data.
So, when the mechanical strength that was able to replace, that was introduced by industrial revolution, started to include the Artificial Intelligence of the Computers.
And mobility?
And the Internet had the time we started to live the time we've lived now, which we're living now, the one that's called the Internet, and this second, a phenomenon of creation and destruction.
Because I'm essentially an industrial process that tells us that what is new progressively destroyed what is old, because we need to do space, and we'll see better then how.
But this is the story of the great numbers, of the great inventions, but there's a story that is a little more human, that belongs to us a little more, on which I try to make a reflection, I try to accompany you.
It was 1863, when, little by little, the Italy hasn't made the Italians yet.
The Minister Mingetti, put in English finances, establishes that the 27th of the Middle Ages, is corresponded to the payment and public dependents.
And from 27 to the next months, that this happens.
And at this moment, even if we don't realize it, we're introducing ministers, something extraordinary, before the wealth of a family, more than a singer, was in their ability to produce good services, which were necessary to their own support.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky of the stages, less risky of the elevation, it started in some way to move away from the Earth.
And above all, it has transformed the economic power to be able to produce goods and services in the production of one.
Well, the dwell.
But there's a second aspect, which is the fridge for us, and that it's not only the object that frees us from the emergency of going to do the spirit every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to preserve, in a massic way, a structure in a healthy way, in quantity of food, which has been the fridge.
So it gives us the possibility, once again, to focus on something that is not immediately the urgency of the daily life.
But this is the man who begins.
To live to the end of November, these are us.
At the time, as we said, the speed, the speed of the reactions, the speed of the movements, the speed of our movement, the speed of our movement, and then there's a figure that has characterized these years, there's an element that we can define as the qualification of these years, the speed of our thinking that is not said quality of thinking, but we are very fast.
But until then something happened.
It's typically close when you look at the story, to understand the passengers from one century to the other, and sharing data that are not necessarily zero.
In 1900, 1900, 2000, when we can say that the 20th century is finished, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary passage, which is two data that is significantly signed in the passage of an episode, from another one, 2001 and 2001 because in the beginning.
And the American economy started to slow down, and on the other hand, there were Torri Gemelli, and so something in balance has started to change: these equilibrium that seemed solved are very fragile.
But we went forward until there was something that has slowed all the time, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world, and the oriental world together, had never met, there was no only America to have slowed, almost closed, there was also the orientation.
In other words, there were European states that were to fail, the Greece was already the leaves of failure, they don't talk about it, but it's still there, and it changed something, but what has changed, the economic paradigm, we couldn't.
But not to wait for the biggest economic crisis that, in fact, if verified in 2008 was crazy not to think about it, but how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension?
With many less people.
It was obvious that it would happen: we were blind, we didn't know how to wait, look at these companies.
These companies are not innovated inventing something, they haven't innovated building something that wasn't there before, but above all, they are all companies that are Dante after 2011, that they started to do what we've always done, to buy, to travel, learn.
The different way, the most efficient way.
And the Italy, which is often denied: we try to look at the state of health and digital Italy, according to five factors, connectivity, we are almost close to a connection between 50 percent and little.
Anyway, something, according to human skills, human resources, competences of curving it, of a different being, between advanced and basic skills, the vast competences where they allow us to develop them.
But a third picture we have to look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it.
A third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of the digital factor in productive processes.
So, comets, or industrialization of products and services, the fifth is digitalization.
The system of public administration, we immediately have the field of some ambiguity, and we keep the beginning of two years ago, so, in the system of publication, we are growing fast, there are new operators, new competitions, a very important competition, there are all five elements that are in a growth, we are slowly connected to the countries.
In fact, it was born a very profound change that is aligned to our country's future, and they are the skills and the inclusion of the digital in brutal factors.
And in this way we have to pay a lot of attention to the characteristics of our country: we have two engines, the first motorcycle.
It's what made the Italy in the '50, there are the small companies.
Long from being, the small business, something not useful, not effective, not paragonable to the big multinational companies, in fact.
I'm probably the most effective entrepreneurial tool to interceive the speed of change: they're agile, they're speeds, they're small.
They know how to do something extraordinary that the Made in Italy has an excellence in the production of service, in the production of products, which is quite unique in their gender, everyone wants it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, competences inside these realities, because these realities can become those multinationals that can help.
It's an internal segment of the market, the first great motorcycle, the second motorcycle that in Italy, is its cultural artistic heritage, and this is the first assault that we have, the first great motorcycle, we can't digitalize the crop.
But is it possible that tourists only visit three cities?
Venezuela, Firences, Rome, and then they repeat, and we're learning, maybe we've tried to start, but we're fast to recover, to include this heritage inside a knowledge system that allows us to carry it and enjoy it not only to visit three centers, but to visit all our country.
The topic I spoke about in a certain sense is the opposite act of the word "unifies."
That's all.
Our encounter is the opposite of the word "share," because I'll talk not about sharing, but in a certain sense of the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'll talk about inequality, I'd like to start first.
Yes, with a question: But if someone asked you?
According to you, in the last 15, 20 years, we say, in the 21st century, inequalities in the world, the inequalities between the citizens of the world are increased or are decreased.
But I believe most of you will answer, "If I asked you, but in Italy, maybe the answer of many of you would also be increased."
I asked myself these questions in the last few years, and with the only 24th and the foundation of video.
I've prepared with my colleagues a report on the inequalities from when they are artists, that is, financially, from 1960 to the great majority of the countries in the world.
Audience: Yes.
The result is what you see.
This is the curve of the disguised inequality between the citizens of the world, as you can see, there was indeed an increase of inequalities, especially in the '80s, but from the end of the last 90s.
And in Italy, compessive inequality between the citizens of the world is crowned and precipitated, now we are at the storal mining.
In Italy, we must say that inequality is quite complicated, even here we have an increase throughout the 80s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second Republic.
AC: We have a decreasing inequality trend.
How can we read these data?
Well, it's a possible reading is to say that many of us, the same, and it's true, surely in this reading, but we could also ask ourselves another question, and if the feeling of a moment of inequality we've taken a collective bathroom, because we continue to talk about years of increase inequality.
How do we find it?
(Laughter) It wasn't wrong the feeling, but it was wrong the idea of inequality on which.
We're right.
(Audience) Yes!
Maybe we have to think about the issue of inequality, about what we understand for inequality.
Perhaps the concept of inequality requires some rethink.
We leave temporary in suspicious this question, and we move around a century.
And also, we move to Cambridge in 1928, a year before the great Church of the 29th, Lickens.
It was Cambridge, there was a speech in front of you.
It has a student audience, a speech has become famous with the title "Posibility Economic for our grandchildren," the first says, in that occasion, "Keynes forms two professions."
It was a century, productivity.
But one hour to work will be.
Other times the one of today, that is 1928.
And this profession, in fact, is made, because if you go to take the reconstructions of the history of the economy, in most of the advanced society, we have an increase of productivity in the turn of 100 years, which is also of...
Ten, twice times, in some case, 15 times, so this teacher of there, in a few years, would also be found with a huge amount of free time that would have taken it to work less.
And he also said, working all the time, and he saw a problem for this, because the question that was asked Keynes, but with all this free time we knew how to use it well, or not.
Apparently, this second path wasn't made.
Because we all see it, that we don't all work, and it doesn't seem exactly what we work three hours a day.
I'll show you that this profile is divided in two parts: neither one that says we'll all work, it's certainly false, but the first part we'll work a lot less, we'll work three hours a day, we're sure we'll see here in Italy.
This curve, or this trajectory, represents the time fraction.
And the interesting thing is that this 16% dedicates to the beginning of 900 almost 40% of our lives naturally, potentially working, that is, for the 15 years, then, when we are working, and now we call it about 16 percent.
Two hours and a room a day, that is, the barrier of the three hours, in Italy, we've already collapsed it.
Naturally, if this happened to us, they study long studies, for example, the old age is enormous from the beginning of the last century, from 900; there's another reason, perhaps more fundamental, for which our fourth of time.
Dedicated to work and crowned.
And it's the test of occupation, that is, the number of people who work.
This is the storal series of total occupation.
It's built for this occasion and this dramatic series, because it makes you see what?
At the beginning of the century, in all monarchical era, before the Second World War, the occupation rate has always been inferior to 50%.
But a rate of inferior occupation to 50 percent, what does it mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, that is, pure consumers who don't perceive any network are more workers.
In front of this?
In fact, storal, we can also have a relationship.
But then we see if in the country that the problem of modernity, that is in the United States, things have been in the same way, because if this interpretation is fair, it should have happened even in the United States, and then we see the confrontation between Italy.
You were united.
This is the storal series of time.
It's dedicated to work in life, as you can see, and the United States only calms up to the 30s, then it's established, and the storal series of the occupation rate, because here we see.
There's an increase, that small one you see below is the crisis of the 29th, but after the crisis of the 29th, we have a general tendency of the occupation rate in the United States at the increase, and in our case we have a situation of reduction.
The occupation task.
But then, this is a pathology.
It's not normal.
"What?"
But they are more people who consume without producing than the people who produce.
It's not normal that the majority of the population lives in a condition that I'll define dependence in parassitary, dependence, because, depending on the network of Twisia, this, you can also be a family or the State, but it seems to work.
Audience: Yes.
I, a friend who does theater act, when I found these results, we were in the scene and asked them, "But how did you represent this situation with an image, a situation of parasitary dependence?"
With the hypothesis, it's that light that lives on the spots of the hypothesis, but it's called buffag, some say buffaga, here it is.
If you want to have an idea of how it behaves.
The bubble or the bubble on the prototype, or on the other big mammals, these birds also live on the bridges, on the bubbles, well, we have this thread that we see these...
These fish.
As they live, if the bubble is happy with the eye that can mean that it's playing, whether it's invested by the light, even if this is the sociologist, so the question that I've asked myself as a sociologist.
And society, gentlemen, as a society in which there's this kind of productive consumer, the first one, there's a society that has put in the condition of living without working, but naturally it's not enough, you have to add a qualification.
It could be defined by ignorant society, but it's a mass society.
Audience: Yes!
And here the clear report is a relationship of commanding and subtle consumers, because the consumers are more productors, because Greek Dubezson, a great psychologist anthropologist, would have defined it to a relationship of Open Legam, we see why, in the society, the classic signs, we have the sign and the signs of the jungle that produce it.
The relationship?
From bubble with the hypothesis and parasitism, and this is a advantage signed in green, but it's also dependence, because it depends on food that is on the spices of the body.
And also from the point of view of producers, we have, again, a green fresh, the autonomous hypothesis doesn't need bubble, but it's in some way, in a relationship of obligation, as we are, in the face of colors that live on their spices, so the situation is very complex.
That doesn't go well.
Is it a situation in which?
There's a new problem of inequality, and now we get there.
And the best situation in the Italy, in this scale of inequality of access to work and dramatic access to work, we can use the tools that are simply because there is the exclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, we would probably have the palm of this creator, together, to Turkey, to work, with the United States, months in the middle.
They need us to become an Oxis country, normal, seven million jobs.
How did we get to this: this is the story of inequality of access to work in Italy, always measured in any kind of genius, you can see something clamorous, that inequality is the minimum, during the work positions in more, our families.
(Laughter) But here I conclude, there would be 1,000 euro per month, in more, we would have 12,000 euro per year, and our State would have 150 billion euros to spend as much as the health and the school has put together, more or less in Italy.
Nights.
We have the scholarship to write in the first article of the Constitution, "The Italy is a democratic Republic based on work, we are the only country."
It has this in the first title of the Constitution, and we are the worst country together with the Turkey of the West.
So, we change things.
The seven million jobs that work, or maybe better to reach the article one of the Constitution, and we believe that being so things sound like a BEFA.
Thank you.
