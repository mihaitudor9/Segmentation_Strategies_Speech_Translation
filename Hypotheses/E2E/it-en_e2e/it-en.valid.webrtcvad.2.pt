(Applause)
In 2016, I was given a award, from the National Parliament, supported by the Ministry of instructions in Irlanda, from the name a little particular, supported to sponsorize from the Ministry of the United Nations.
They are born in Church.
KA: The motivation of this award was my availability in the confrontation of the students and my ability to create data environments.
Less formal, more reassuring, let's imagine that this is a big university class.
So, usually, I go to class.
The first ten minutes, when the students enter and get there.
I put my computer to explain and put a classic music, I think this is the first step to create less forming data environments and try to maintain the attention of the students.
Unfortunately, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a method used until the old age.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, the storytelling is a method based on the use of narratives.
To transmit knowledge to students.
And just with this method that I'd like to start my lesson explaining to you to describe a topic about the mouth of everyone, already.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories you tell in children, I'd like to start my story.
There was once.
Second World War.
1942, a nest.
Blockchain Park.
A northern residence of London.
There was a young and 30 years old.
Alan Turing.
Let's go to the classroom of Cambridge and get a research doctor in logic, the Princeton University in America.
At that time, the Tedes used a machine.
Special.
It's enigma.
It was like a writing machine.
The operator digitalized details, but old that stuck on a paper.
From those letters, I stuck other letters, according to a code imposed mechanically under the machine.
The texts used this mechanism to communicate with them.
But anyone would interceive this paper in front of you without any sense.
It was shouting.
Alan Turing was one of the main paintings in Black Park.
Take a look and build them a machine.
It's the one you can see.
In other words, I can decipher.
This test is written by the TEDx.
For this invention, we think that war is finished with two years of anticipation.
It's saving many human quickly.
Alan Turing continues, after the war, to do its logical research.
(Audience) Yes.
And it's considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
With your Turing machine, he formalizes the concept of computer, even before the computer was created in practice.
In 1950, an article published on the "Mind magazine."
"Computing machine learning" is in intelligence.
Where does the test indicate?
The question behind the testing is a very precise one.
They can think the machines.
From here on, artificial intelligence began.
Probably many of you have seen the movie of the United States, the game of limitation, I want to explain to you.
But do we suppose there's a person here?
The request is to be the computer.
That asks questions and on the other hand, a machine M is an operator.
In an alternative way, the machine M and the opponent O.
They provide the answers to the person.
(Laughter) It's said that the machine takes over the Turing test if the person is not able to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the operator.
This is limiting a game.
The machine must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
You must interpret the natural language.
The question that comes from the person must represent knowledge to form the answers.
It must think in an automatic way to form these answers.
And it must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence.
One of these is the cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
(Applause)
According to this process, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to capture thinking.
In the moment they are born.
Or we try to modify the thinking at a psychological level.
That's why artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive neural sciences and psychology.
According to this approach, the assunction that if we can really have a female representation of human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of the laws of rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man?
All the men are dead.
Socrates are mortal.
This is a deductive argument.
Do you give two premises to laugh?
It's dedicated to a real conclusion: from here the logic of the whole, according to the approach of the laws of the thought.
We try to build educational arguments.
And to see them in a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational agents.
A rational agent, an entity.
(Laughter) It must act.
It must be adapted to the context.
It must take them goals, and know how to take them to end.
And it must act in a rational way.
So Test Duturin is linked to intelligent people.
Reforming the Turing phrase can think about it.
We can say, "Can we create a machine?"
An artificial agent.
I'm able to think.
To exhibit intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence, so it's at the purpose of creating artificial entities, intelligent, your phone is an entity.
Among the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence as psychological construct.
Once we have more knowledge.
What about this?
What's the point?
It's close to build artificial, intelligent identity and support of man.
It's a title.
That's what I want to do.
But let's see today.
If machines can think.
I'd like to explain to you to describe the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I'd like to use.
Five classes to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We have subtle agents.
Stop human beings.
We have human beings, and finally we have optimal agents.
I want to explain to you with some examples: optimal agents are the people who act better than all men and can't do better.
For example, people who solved the Rubik cube, play a four-year-old strength in the best way, play a sad one, think that a few years ago a young man has resulted.
It was the beginning of the Rubik cube, it has resolved it in 4.73 seconds.
A few months ago, they created an agent, a robot that was able to solve in zero.63 seconds.
Do we have the sovereign agents?
Do they act better than all people?
For example, in the game of the rocks.
In the game of the scarce.
A few years ago, the Russian camp of Skakis, Gaspora, was killed by an artificial agent.
We have people who suffer humans, those who manage almost like all people, for example in the game of the little craft.
I'll answer the question of the kiss.
We had our own hands.
What do they act?
Almost like all people.
For example?
In cognitive activities like the crowned words.
Or the classification of the image?
Finally, we have subtle people who manage the worst of all people.
Exemples are the classification of objects.
The recognition of calligraphy, the vocal recognition, the translation of a language to the other.
But if there's something that artificial agents, today, are not able to do, for example, is a disambiguation.
We're talking about the result.
How?
The mum.
Or are we talking about the mark of the body Apple?
And one thing that agents are not able to do is reasoning in the ideal world, in uncertainty situations.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence, so you think we are far from overcoming the test.
But let's see now in the future.
They will be able to think the machines.
A few years ago, in America, a thing was introduced by the name of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest experts in artificial intelligence in the world.
Imagine the time line.
Imagine a line that indicates the human intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a red line that indicates the machine intelligence with an exponential environment.
This is a blind moment.
The previous environment in the wall's laws, for which computational compassion, for example, measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, radiated for two years and in four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to...
It's the use of this computer complexity to stimulate the human brain.
I don't see anything.
In 2020 we would have access to 1,000 dolls to this computer capacity.
In 2025, secondary and crossed, I'll never be able to get rid of our brain in a precise way.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will pass the test, they will overcome the test.
And then, in 2045, and the indication, the moment in which technology singularity will have.
In which machines will follow the intelligence of the machines will follow an exponential environment that will radically change.
Human intelligence.
In his article.
It's published on the Mind magazine.
The tourists don't only proposed their tests, but they also propose new objections against their own test.
These objections are us against artificial intelligence.
But a few years ago?
Unfortunately, a few years ago, one of the compounds we had to move was to propose, to the student at the University of Varese, followed a path of ethology and ethics of computer science, given by the Gaithan professor Aur√©lio Lanzerone, against Twing test.
I'll tell you about artificial intelligence.
I was the only one that proposed a decade formulated, mathematical communication.
What about human stupidity?
Do you want to describe it in simple terminals, do we suppose to take the intelligence of all people?
Let's put the seed.
The symbol of submission to the minister side of the equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
Good afternoon, we had...
An equality of intelligence.
But in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were us?
To transfer our intelligence inside a machine.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we left the machine become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story ...
Let's ask myself to the initial question.
They can think the machines.
I'd like to leave you.
With an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you (Applause)
(Applause) (Music)
(Applause)
Good afternoon.
(Applause)
How many of you today have taken pictures?
Thank you.
Well, this gives me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in the bathroom, and I'm a journalist who takes care of photography, I'm the creative director of a study that takes care of photography, which is a photographer, which is the product and diffused through the cell phone.
Her limits, their contradictions, their potentialities, their impact on the market, their projectual and self-esteem, but there are many others, in which way the photographer changes the processes through which we communicate.
In order to find answers to these questions, I've tried to open a confrontation with photo-Editer, careers, critical and theorists who, in the midst of the photographer, have had a new language in order to develop experiences and reflexions, I've asked them to share with me the anatomy of their projects.
To find answers, I looked around and arrived in New York, at the DSC of the New York Times Megers in Cathy Ryan.
In Berlin, in the AIM sede, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock.
In Parigi, in the rooms of Parifot, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world, to enter those places in which photography is distributed, it's based on these engratulations.
To find answers, I tried to look beyond the surface of the great common places of the contemporary.
For example, selfie, the selfie to get involved, simply to a delirium narcissistic, like some sociologists have sustained with the body dismorphism of body dismorphism, and to put themselves in connection as some psychologists have sustained by visual benefits of the generation of the millennials, as "Key d'Aard Ben".
Or the Asho Lagger, the phyto-pintage aesthetics that has still segregated our mobile vision.
This is my dog, Zazi, a victim designed by my photographic experiments, and it's simply the result of a world's world's worldwide epidemic, or, instead, as it has sustained the social and historical nature, even economical.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of answers, it's the territory of interpretations, and of this phenomenon I've tried to give an interpretation in a book.
It seemed useful to try to draw a map, if not to find the route, at least to understand what we are, called "revolution," I mean, for a story of the bad photography, because in front of the flower of images we are exposed, it seemed to me useful.
And how are we, the story of the Mobile Photography is short, but in a few years I've invented millions and millions of people?
A new code that exceeds every linguistic barrier, used daily to communicate, to test ourselves, to feed a constant flow of images that make individuals from an angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collective world, if you want, that has impressive numbers.
Every two minutes, today, we take more images of how many Americans have taken in the burden of the year 20th century.
More than 350 million of these images are carried every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production and the diffusion of images, of activities that, until a few years ago, looked at a research collection of professionals, became an instinct of the action of our daily experience.
A form of social interaction, a channel of proof of our private sphere in public dimension.
In which we define ourselves through the images we produce, or better, we exist because we produce images.
And if the photographer is a new language, then it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that is still strongly signed by that process of liquidity, so brilliantly individualized by the Zygmunt Bauman philosophy, as a typical of a modernity, the coppy, I'm always more fascinating, and here actors are unstable points in a universe in a more natural movement, a liquid vision that is composed of compounds.
It's constantly based on the instant gratification of our shared need, but in a world where each one, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone.
That the rule remains the professional photographer and that differences pass through Western photographs and photographeres, on one hand, the facility of using the cell phone's camera has transformed the photography to mix for professionals, the universal language.
Fortunately, with the process of democratization of photography, I started with the era Kodak and arrived until the iPhone.
On the other hand, the use of the cell phone as a reward tool offered to professional photographers.
Nine possibilities in approach to stories, to the contents, to the subjects.
Still, on one hand, the opening to everyone, to all of us, of a dialogue channel, with a potentially global audience, has moved the professional photographer of their exclusive void as a producer of images, has put me in crisis the social function, the economic position.
We just need to think of the rule that had the photographer and social network in the first Arab Spring.
I'm showing you that being a powerful tool to orient public opinion and a capture of information and hardly controlled by the kings, this is an image of "Caero thinking," a sample that has dedicated to the rule of the photographer in the first Arabic, on the other hand, but...
Let's think that the possibility of direct interaction through the web, through Instagram, between the photographer and the audience, has liberated the photographer from the obliged passage.
For the hands of the editor, the liberated by the need to undertake a political agenda, a editorial line detected by others, and not always based on journalistic priorities, I've liberated it from the impossibility of reaching the limited resources.
And he allowed them to put themselves directly into the use of the news, traveling.
Do you keep visits in real time, a particularly interesting example?
The offer is the Mega-Zenthim, in 2012, with the cover of Instagram photography, and it can directly be found by a American photographer, Rayce, Cournist, and dedicated to the conservation of the universal heritage of the T-COber's Revolution, which has had origin after this experiment.
Nine paths of curatory selection, like 1415 mobile photographers, created by those Italian photographers, Giulio Napolitan and George Kosulic, through a job of scalp in the highest levels around a topic, but then there are the photos and distributed through the iPhone, created by this tool, with a great consciousness.
I'm photos like Michael Cristo Fer Brown.
Benjamin Loui.
"Orona Vive," who have used and use the smartphone in conflict territories, showing how agility and description of the means can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of deepness.
The photographer Metero Coyaama, who, from a simple smartphone, has explored new paths for Newsmaking, creating a well-being platform to put in touch the American soldiers in the south of Afghanistan with their families, and to create a motor of information from the front of the first hand.
Bred Mengin, who used it for sport photography, exclusive territory of photographers with hyper-performant appearances, and made a beautiful narration of intimate narration on the best League of Baycebol.
(Video) Research Cirnandt, who enjoyed the discretion and manner for the photographer, creating a very personalistic aesthetics.
I'll tell you that he made a small report, going back to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, and creating a community that attacks the parts around his job.
MTIC that uses it daily to build its family album, inerting a reflection on how Instagram changes the facts of our privacy, and the way we build and preserve our visual memory.
Peter of Campo, who, through the African Countain, has shown how the photographer, far from limiting themselves to generate visual cliches, can also be used to discuss the Western stereotypes on the crisis and the fame, has shown to the story of a daily Africa.
Like Stephan of Luigi who interpreted the Omer's story with the cell phone, telling in the AI series, one of the oldest heritage of the history of the West, with the new vision tool.
Or as I've been born in Lourlin, who has photographed the manifestants in Piazza, who, during the protests of Mai-Tan, with a beautiful poetry, and contemporary scholarship, well, what do we all know how to do?
Speaking of images that have never been straightened to reality, but that are born from a deep interaction between photographer and subject, contaminating the code of the storytelling, designing their own content to be diffused in different platforms and reaching different audiences.
To make network using the connections in an innovative way.
Putting on the authority exercise of its point of view on the world, and on the quality of deepness, because anyway is the tool that is solved by a solid, articulated and in a powerful way.
It can be distinguished from the visible rumor of the bottom that offers us the eyes.
All of this, I believe, makes the difference between a photograph that is, in fact, its bullying, reproduction, its self-reference and sharing, and a photography that can still be a cultural metaphor.
Thank you all (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
Actually, what we believe is silence, are 50 axes of electric race.
There are 50 thirds that are immediately entered in our lives.
We wake up from the illusion that silence exists.
I don't exist to myself.
So also in this room, those providers, these seeds, and put a frequency of 50RS, so you can imagine yourself, not, go home after a work day, really stressing.
Mangicle, your partner, with your partner, except then you'll have read in the bubble of your bed camera and think you're alone, but no, I simply have a volumease.
Because it's imperceptible in our homes, in our lives, but it's more or less this sound.
(Music)
We have a positive perspective, or better, first of the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist, but we have a positive aspect.
We are never alone, that is, always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Very good, pregnant.
And if we look at it as a drawing, this frequency of 50 times is nothing more than a sound wave, a wave is now with a beautiful rich spectrum, with which we can make music, and then I'm asked, "But why not make us music?"
So, I'm a composer of sound colonies, an artist, I'm now, or a little particular, because I'm complicated life deciding to make music alone and exclusively through rumor.
My parents divorced when I was little, and I know you think this is the classic story in Strapalacre, but, instead, it was the revelation of my life, so every complement of the network wasn't anymore.
(Applause) A classic complement of the network, we were immobile, full of voices, but it becomes my musical tool, with a joy between the other of my mom, that every dot wasn't thinking about the streaming, and this is a great thank you very much.
Of course, I say, at some point...
I'm sure you're going to become a normal person, trying to say, "I've tried because I started studying Chitarra."
It's a strong piano.
Then I liked Woody Allen, so I started to create the grandson, the problem I really liked Arenzo Arvor, who wrote a beautiful song in Bigoa, was coming like the first years of study in Genova.
I didn't even abandon Clarinetto.
And that's how, to not give us the illusions of my classmates.
But why did I abandon all this, why did I study and escape from that notation so rigid?
Because there's more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more sponsor in a rumor, and I like to paragonate it to the problems of life.
We all attacked a rumor, a failure, something that made us think, but I'm sure that that that that rumor made us grow much more.
So, from a smile, that's why my mission ...
So when I'm a child, it's to transform a failure, a rumor in music, and harmonize everything that's around me.
"Thank you."
Do you open it?
I'll have everything, right?
I say, "Let's make a beautiful turning point of dollar, Gino Paoli, and everything would be concluded, but no, I'm complicated in this way.
What is sound?
But above all...
What is the study, and with the saying, is one of the most difficult senses to understand, but also the most immediate, the most powerful.
To transmit an emotion: our internal eye, the protein of the oceans, our team, reaches the maximum functionality around the fifth week of gesture.
I say, the fifth week of gesture, this means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to listen even before seeing, and this is not a case.
Because the fact must be ready.
I know that the sponsor in life, once born, must be ready to the northern texture, it shouldn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So, in a case, if the mother, during the pregnancy, listened to Panchroco British, hasn't been stupid if the child, once was born, will be sleeping, listening, for example, sex Pistols, so ... (Applause)
But what is sound?
Well, the sound is everything we're surrounded, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
Audience: Yes!
It's what, in our lives, is completely abstract.
You don't see yourself, you don't touch yourself.
For me, the colony is time for every day, the rhythm in our partner, the mother who screams us, because the mother writes us, still, always.
All of this is the sound colony of our days.
"Yes."
Of course, the visual is much easier.
We don't know.
The visual is when we enter the system's hair, we say.
It's smaller than how I imagined them.
There's smaller than the man of Milan, smaller than what.
"Are you smaller at home?"
(Laughter)
And you understand the same thing as when a person sees me in video, or on stage, and then I tell you a person, and says to me, "I imagined high, well, of course, even because it's lower, it would be really impossible."
Going from this budget, the visual ...
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
(Audience) Yes!
Let's imagine our lives, I'd like to genuine your ability to observe, so we're in vacation.
We're in the sea, not in case, and we start a soccer blog, then there's the open aircraft, so we call a drone to take a photo of the drunk, on top of the bottom, we don't do it, but also those, talking about food, kilometers, kilometers, kilometers, and kilometers don't sound, I't know, I't have a lot of money.
"Food" and nobody sends the doll.
We photograph it, we look at it.
We make many videos, but we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I teach you a trick: when you put them with someone ...
The best moment to know the person is to stay in silence, that silence that, among the other, doesn't exist: go for two, and...
To listen.
Close yourself and listen.
Like in this moment.
So, today I'd like to take you with me, I'd like to bring you with me.
It was moving around the world.
Your perception of listening.
And I'd like to start by telling you...
The dream of my life, the dream of my life that is born from school.
Of myself.
For the first time, the listening of myself was 2013, I wanted to run away from the History, a series of failures, problems and others.
That's it, I decided to choose, which later turned into harmony, but I started looking for a very far place in Italy.
A city on the Atlantic.
There was the Atlantis, it's true, there was still a lot, I came to an artistic resident, I started the most beautiful years of my life, for the simple fact that for the first time I was listening to myself, there was still a lot, culturally artistic city, and really far away from me.
So, I didn't have money, I had so much fear, I had an idea, but I was the only one to believe us, where for 48 hours in the top, I registered the sounds of the city, and the whole part, really, to enter the city, calling this project "Sound of Syria."
And I created a sound colony.
So, at this moment...
I want to sound: Shanghai.
(Applause) (Cheers)
In Ivo Vat√£o, I'm experiencing that I'm the only one in the car.
(Video) Ricardo Chiaretti: I'm a writer, I'm angry, an imbalance.
(Video) (English) In my heart, I'm the one who's the most specialist in the middle of the rock.
(Video) (Video) (English) I'm a writer, I'm a writer, I'm a young man, I'm a young man, I'm a young man, I'm a young man, I'm a young man, I'm a little old man.
(Music) (Applause) You've all heard it, you've still focused on the visual, and this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say that it's a test, it's all collected to the visual.
Now.
There's a city that is sure, you've photographed, in every way, and you're asked more than once, but that smoke that comes from the tombs that are done, but the bridge of Brookly is an exceptional exilephon, completely in leg.
And I want to add it to the top.
(Making drum-like sounds) (Making drum-like sounds) (Making drum-like sounds) (Making drum-like sounds) (Music)
(Applause) I'll tell you about the Counter that is really focused on the side and something important to say.
Hello, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because on the other hand of the world.
It's not magical because it's on the other hand, it's magical because under our eyes every day.
And maybe many of you know a pair of places.
In this picture...
The sound rule is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, going around a city, losing yourself in the same city, well, I knew Genova.
I knew Genova, because there were many times, there were absolutely captured many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to them in this way I can tell you that, among my favorite cities, now, I've heard the applause, I'll tell you... (Applause) That's it, I started to record the first sounds, I started to record the first sounds.
And I'll make you feel, before the Greek camp, and then, that's worked.
(Music) And now that's elaborated: And I came out to the big sphere.
And I like a bit - I've always done it - that I'm not normal, I've never been - I've attacked this beautiful and replaced me a very low frequency that has become a synthesiser.
(Music) His name is Laborato.
(Laughter) And it wasn't a battle, this serious thing: Genova is "Morzandis."
Let's give a moment.
The writing, which you see constantly in the pity of Ferrari, is not just a writer, for me it's a great musical tool, and helped me to support the sound of this colony.
It's more or less like this.
(Music) This is the opposite.
But the last sound, after I really want to sound new, is that of...
Look at the doors' boats.
That we are used to look at it, but the sound is a perception that is opposed to the view, and so I created this microphone, I immersed it for 48 hours.
In Genova's port, I found a sound of a track that gave me a particular frequency that became melody and when it became the melody, it's because putting it in the loop is transformed in what the voice of the colony is gold.
(Sounds) This is its rock.
(Music)
It's true.
Well, now I'd like to make you feel Genova, but I've come to this point, "No."
Here's Genova as a sound.
"Ah!"
(Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music)
(Applause) OK.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
(Laughter) Any sound of our passions in my and your passions, and for how many people will tell you that they're rumorous, stuck out of time, you really want to listen to them, and I always bring you to listening, thank you (Applause)
(Applause)
As it's said Guybek in Italian, the word generally used is restitution, it's not perfect, but the idea of the idea, in generating the idea of restitution linked to monetary institution to the benefit.
Many times, instead, the restitution is related to restricting what you did, what you learned.
And going from the part of those who say, "It doesn't work anything," then in Italy it doesn't work anything in this country, we try it, so the next 18 minutes shared some point of this story.
But going from the end of the '90s, in 1999, precisely, this is my son's army.
In the same year, my monkey organized the collection of funds to pay the material to Redesio, next to Segrate.
From the Azilo.
It was an activity.
Very heavy, made with many parents, some of them said, "No, why should we help, we must think about the common state?"
Most of them were extraordinary.
To help the asylum, to help the community, a million and 200,000 readers, because they don't remember, they're 600 euros away.
And it was one of the efforts, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later, we take the United States, this is...
It's similar: the same scenario for a nearby school, and this is the biggest children.
And there's a completely different reality, which was extraordinary for us, we realize that it's a totally extraordinary reality.
In other words, the thing of the game Beck of the restitution is very normal.
So the extraordinary effort of an Italian genital is ordinary for all that society.
Not that the American society is perfect.
So much.
I said this, the thing of restitution: I've had fortune, I'll replace it.
It helps school.
It helps the university, it helps the museum, the the the the theater, there are all the communities, financially, live of...
The restitution of volunteer.
There's no volunteer, there's a phenomenon and a positive circle, and then there are also...
The mechanisms, there was fiscal lucidity, there are processes.
It doesn't work, it's not based on this.
I'm ten years old, some of you may have known it, this is the south's launch.
It has the support of the famous Obamaker, Sito who says, "System is the moment."
Trump is trying us very actively to ask ourselves if the system is given to one of the moment.
Obama has launched the famous bank, and there was an incredible technological debate.
Technological balance has been 600 million dollar, so not worried about these things that didn't happen only in Italy.
They build a site that doesn't work for many million contacts, and this is the answer to the standard they received.
In short, you believe you don't finish for a few days, but then someone stopped criticizing, and it's enough to do it.
Going from criticizing, which is easy and normal to try to do and help, which is difficult, extraordinary.
This is us, it's not a common thing.
This is Time Magazine's coverage.
Refigure the experts of technology that were sent by Google and other companies, they were offered.
And I agree with the Bianca house, I wouldn't have architecture, I've put it in the session, I've stayed in a few weeks, at a decim of the costs.
After all, many would have criticized, but Google, surely, has their own interests.
(Audience) Yes!
The extraordinary effort, and not the ordinary, I've seen that I've finished in TAMEGS, was very interesting, and that's what...
I want to explain to you what it was, I've explained to people, more still.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this validity, this bag, and they decided to reproduce the experiences that had filled their lives.
In this case, what can we do?
They look at the ability to manage big technological systems, complex, unbearable processes.
Ripetible.
To make them again replicable and unbearable systems, and to create a replicable system, which is the USA, from this effort, then was born.
It's a replicable system, what we hope to do with us.
I want to talk about the word model, because one also learns about the models, which were the help of our lives, which inspired us, that they taught us.
Those who taught you perseverance, the desire to never move, to continue to insist.
Energy, empathy.
So these are the models that are part of this bag that we have to use, we want to reproduce.
And for me, obviously, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also the factor: Italy.
Almost 30 years ago from the History, the idea of helping was also because I'm Italian.
What about it?
I wanted to do it: two rounds of risk, three.
To do or not do, there's no attempt, maybe it's in Italian, it's to do or not only to criticize.
Audience: Yes!
A few years later, we were five against San Francisco, and the Visica Avenue to Silicon Valley reins the sensitive need for the transformation in general.
Some things have stopped us a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of processes, for the digital transformation of the public administration, asks me why don't we help the adventure for a couple of years?
I think about it, I think about it, the pavement with my wife, Monica, and I talk to my genius, Jeff Besos.
To have the brief, I decided to apply a choice methodology, so I said, "Don't regret," "Don't paint," in a few years I think I've tried and I didn't get it, or I think I haven't even tried it.
The choice was made, and so it's been sent to the Rome for two years.
A topic of...
(Laughter) Ah, Amazon!
But those who have to do it, Mallia, Amazon, Probono, Maiday, something will give you underwater, these are only many phrases, I have to say that we've also received so much support, so at this moment we're focusing on this part, but in a positive part there was.
I was mentally preparing the skeleton and the bureaucracy, people ask me, "But do you expect this little box?" And yes, I didn't expect it, of course?
But the scientist should have often cynicism that characterizes a certain mentality, I will never do it, of course, because you don't have rights, I've heard a lot of this kind.
This country, in fact, lacks a lot the sense of common good.
To do things because you think you're helping to improve a situation not only because it's not interested.
And here's it, for the days of you, this is a commissioner, for the most elderly you recognize it, as a extraordinary commission, and simply because it's their rule that allowed me to be able to take people from the public administration.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is: how do the systems from inside don't transform themselves, do we want to try to transform them with people who come from outside, where the fact that they don't know the public administration?
It's an asset.
So, financially, we created a small team, I wanted it to be a small team, I told you 25 people, a new one.
It's not big, but it's also too small: technological experts around 80% are expected to make legal judges.
The governative of communication.
Here you can see the post I had done when, by myself, I started this adventure, I said, because we don't write what I think will happen.
In this way, we want to attract talents, talents that you live in Italy, or that you want to come back.
Also temporary, it has a very well-being compassionate compassion to what you see.
How do I keep you?
So I put myself in the idea, but how do I convince someone to do the same thing I'm doing?
On the other hand, maybe some of you recognize it, that white photograph of the bright of the beautiful, that in the '47s all the United States have put the children of the phone, all the United States, in this massive sport.
I've visited the investments of infrastructure.
We created the vision that the operative system of the country is a series of fundamental components to build simpler services for citizens, public administration and companies.
Through innovative digital products.
The very beautiful vision, the invention, is the blood and blood.
I've continued in my place: soccer field in Salita, since the American soccer, if I don't make mistakes.
And I continued, we'll also have many rules complicated, sometimes incomprehensible, it's a easy prediction.
We should learn to manage with intelligence and bureaucracy, many will say, "Don't understand how public administration works."
They've already talked about it in many, they've failed, in Italy it doesn't work like that.
And we will continue, we'll get many criticisms: some comments will be useful, others will be cinemas and prejudices.
The criticisms of the first type will come from people who really want to offer their contribution, and we've found them a lot.
The second type of color they want to defend the state of the school is that they always see the bubble in the middle of the void.
Or that, simplerly, the helplessness is drawn.
And this is our problem: to teach things that don't work.
That's it.
Remember this image: the first, men and women on the cover of Time Magazin.
Here's it.
So, despite looking for the most possible people to do with the eye, I received about three,000 questions.
From that certainly, at least a scientist, we decided to qualify, we used digital tours for ecologists, an app called Jazz, we have it in the middle of the government.
It has made a mathematical test, a technological test, the team has gathered the mass of CRP, so there are seven people in the genius, and now we are a little more enthusiastic, and it has immediately started to operate, what do we do?
(Laughter) In fact, we take care of Draulica.
These are the tubes of the public administration, some of them to do a lot about connecting, because it's a big problem.
What? What?
The systems, the processes, the applications, anything that should be interconnected, is "asylos" and doesn't connect.
And I'm not only talking about Washington Machim, I'm also talking about people who don't want to explore their own data, their own applications, so it's inside the concept to explain it and explain it, and in years, to implement it, to connectivity, to interruptability.
And sponsor the code of the public administration.
The emergency of the software, of course, is to do so much activity of the project.
So, so much hydraulic activity ...
But we can't also be pictures: to make the services of the beach, in time, you have to do them improving the interface of the tents, making them easier.
All these things are done in parallel, but without the tubes you can't do the painter.
(Audience) Yes!
After a few months, in the midst of 2017 we wrote this month, the piano, Trienna, the Administration Public, and we did it together to the agile of other people who helped us, what is it particularly about the trendal transformation for the digital transformation in the public administration?
And there's one thing that exists.
Two are written in a clear, technological way, but also in the process.
For the first time, it was assessed and sponsorized by the government, by the gentlemen, the decrease of the present that is minister, the digital staff is a priority of the government, the triennal piano.
It requires a team game to simplify public administration, the city of the citizen, particularity of the piano.
Once a year, for those planes, they can't be static, especially in technology.
And it opens to administrations.
What is this, this is the only way to do the piano in Italy, in the public administration?
The regulation revolves the technical rules and read exactly three pains of view and connections to other norms in other rules, and at some point there are technological rules that are quite uncomfortable: unfortunately we can't abolish these things, but we can do it in parallel.
Other things: so the trendal plan is put on the Internet, the technology of you understand it, and put it in shape where we can.
To talk to the administrators, to make us give feedback, the documentary on the rhythm of Ox, in a way that the administrators themselves, the technologies to public administration, the software, the cars can.
I'd like to improve it.
If we dedicate ourselves to this moment, particularly, and this is always a part of the piano, to all the activities of the public administration: the more there will be.
The digital payment is one: the electronic card, the electronic letter, which is a big platform, the identity of digitalizing a platform.
The greatest project we've followed is called the national and resilient population.
"Yes."
Putting this, banalizing technologically, all the data of you, citizens, that at this moment are at 8,000 different sides, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, the only Database, synchron.
Where data is talked through them, especially synchronized, and they talk to the rest of apps of the administration: when I'm transferred to a common to the other, I have to...
First of all, what I was managing, manually, then I have to go to the island, to the motorization, to all those places, I have to say, all those things I've already had to know.
We're solving the technological solution, then we'll do so much about processes.
Two weeks ago, we made a series Akaton.
where 800 software educators have worked on that brilliant application, they were used in 96 interventions.
It was made in 25 Italian cities, without Francisco, even though it's not Italian, but there are many Italian people who are helping us from the technological point of view, like from the History.
All of this reflects, and we're talking about sustainability and scalability in the sight of true for sponsors of Italy.T, where they're exposed, all documentary, and all the codes, but they're always more, apps.
For the Italian publication, now there will be a fifth of what would be left, maybe even less.
The future is today, we dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that normally don't limit themselves to do hydraulic, they also enter the boat.
But it serves that the paintings are complete, sorry, I insist, this can be, for example, one of those things that would like to be.
As we'll leave the alsa aviation, we're the digital citizenship.
You have the phone, smartphone, you have the digital identity, you have data the electronic identity card, it has a stone.
It's already functional, and all this is the purpose of making it easier to familyize the interaction between the citizens and the public administration.
With the simple interaction.
We're dreaming a little, because of work we'll really do so much, but it's different from this vision.
A few weeks ago, the storm ...
It has completed 150 years, the world has written an uncertainty.
They waited for many people to talk about what they think can happen, they asked me to talk about simplification of the lives of every day of the citizens.
I've taken the opportunity to write an article that I want to mention to you.
Some fish.
It's a desire or dream, maybe we do it, we want a country where politicians who try to understand the digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rule and not the exception.
In other words, a country where they read recognize and promote the right to innovate, to embrace it.
A country wants technological skills that are also inside the state and public companies.
A country where there are more public companies and private, guided by 30 years than 70 years.
Imagine, in the end, a country where working for public administration is an owner, where better brains make people work in public research centers, which are green and their accidents of innovation excellence.
What brings development to the country?
So, let's think it's a dream.
And that the components to do all this, digital, technological processes, are really many and maybe too many.
But if you don't have a dream about which points are difficult, you can do things.
First of all, this is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Go to the fact of doing it."
(Audience) Yes!
And here it served somewhere in this theater, at this point, for her, it's more calm, and I couldn't explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the digital Tinder, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do.
Something.
(Laughter) (Audience) Yes!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
And if you want information about us, our site is our social, (Applause)
(Music) (Music)
But did you know the possibility to make a desire?
One only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't go as you'd like.
What would you change?
(Music) What would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your genius, your own collaborators?
You're afraid, you're looking at you, you're going to see that "yes" because here behind I know there's... Then raise your hand those who would change their own body, maybe lose some kilos.
Or maybe win them in muscles?
Ah, here there's already a little more freedom, raise your hand those who would change countless, better understand each other.
Of this, I was sure I would have traveled everyone.
Or maybe you are the ones who would change part of it?
(Audience talking) (Audience) Yes!
More times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
Let's not understand if you'll change the parts, and the answer would be because the elementary ones would have a more united family, but the doctors weren't separated.
Thank you very much.
In the media, I would have wanted to be better, for the pleasure of the youths.
In Liceo, I wanted to feel the most complicated teachers, they seemed to me all the hostiles, and I was reflected in music, here the great voices to make in the living room.
I saw the university, I wanted to work, but I found myself with the difficulty of access to the work market, so all the first part of my life I had been able to fight and fight to try to understand how to change the things that didn't work well.
What others thought about me, to the great economical hands, from interpersonal relationships to my characteristics, acquired from birth.
When did I become a psychologist?
Instead, I looked at my research to other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
These strategies, if you use them in a small dose, could also take some benefit, but as most cases happen, were the only three maps to play in front of a crisis.
Not only did they solve a good nulla, but they ended up maintaining their problems in life.
Audience: Yes.
The strategy, today, more broadcast, is to slow down.
We lie a little bit of everything, there's crisis, there's no work, there's traffic, it's cold, that I'd have done it differently, we lie it because there's no justice.
I know many people who fall in the bottle of the window, and the problem is that if they concede mental space, this paralyzes you.
Typnotize and wake up to the eye spot.
I remember a girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything else than when I started talking to when I stopped going back home.
He started lamenting the ex-fidanced, who left it, then from the girl with whom he had not helped her, felt like having value, ability, and here's where the mind was.
She had completely colonized all her daily life.
But lamenting for all of us is a little effort, you can get a great result: to review the void of the victim that is listened, comfortable, helped.
But be careful.
You can lament yourself at night or day, alone or with friends, at a high voice or in your mind, you can lament yourself of something that has already happened, or something that maybe a tomorrow could happen.
And you can lament yourself at the roof, or as much more often happens, you can lament yourself in the right.
Because we all have many reasons to be able to grow.
But the truth is that for how much you will make you difficultly remember something around you.
It will change, elderly, you won't do anything else than giving more attention to what makes you say.
If the strategy that privileges, when things don't go as you would like, is to lament you.
Let's assume that someone is at the study of a B piano to save the skin.
It invites the magnifying glass.
Another very objective strategy, when things are stretched, is to impose our need.
(Laughter) At the base of this mentality, there's a growing cultural fact that we learned that if something doesn't work well.
It's enough to change it, we can manipulate our pleasure.
What surrounds us, doesn't you like the shadow?
But from aesthetic circle.
(Laughter) You feel a little further, but why never be in the suffering, you take two pillars and we solve it easy?
Your wife breaks you, divorce.
At fresh, we all agree how many risks to the palm.
Your child doesn't listen to you, read it.
It's too big not to register it, to send it to the psychologist, we're here for this, on the other hand.
My vocation, the choice for this, that profession, to make the world around you get involved in the perfection.
What are your demands?
But the environment inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way.
The relationships of coppy.
(Laughter)
I remember one, a copy, during the collapse of which I didn't do anything else than listening to what, according to one, the other would have to change to solve the resources of their future.
So he said, "Yes."
It's true that you, to agree, but not even to prepare yourself in Chinese, which is also a classicone, and she, "No, if you don't look for me, you're not for that, and you don't realize all the things I do for you."
That's it.
Because we have to show all the properties of the other, we have to make them see all the problems that should be cured to reproduce our happiness that has kidnapped us.
(Laughter) But the truth is that if this thing we often say it in a good ugly, believing us deeply.
We can hardly change something, elderly, instead of choosing the node at the base of the relationship, we end up irrigidating them to heal them, if the strategy that privileges them.
When things don't go as you want, the one to impose your need and wait for others to modify themselves as a consequence.
I think about a couple of times, because I'll have a life...
It has resistance, full of hostility.
Audience: Yes.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, is to make us feel like a tool to take the head and put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, there's the fear of facing the conflict that would emerge, that we should show our needs, and then what do we face them for the common good?
It's not the case for me.
But in this way we don't even take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity.
And we live in the merce, we need others.
(Laughter) I remember a young man in the young man, a young man in the young man, a son of separated parents, who, at the end of the first childhood, had learned to distress with great diplomacy between the tips of mom and dad, often spinning from the sound of one, would have lost the love of the other.
In this limited situation, I learned important things, for example, learned.
To listen, to accept, to think about motivations among them, even distant from one from the other, but on the other hand, I've never learned to say no.
They didn't learn the things they didn't go well.
To say no to the relationships they were going to look for it, there was any relationship condition, and elderly, it was one of those who had to always be able to measure, but in this way they had to end their needs, their wishes, their ambitions, they were always submitted to the fear of facing the conflict, and the need to tell all how many.
It's the strategy that privileges, when things don't go like you're, is to suffer your needs.
Audience: Yes.
First, your body will start to talk to you, and instead of all of you, I'll end up failing.
To wake up, to impose your needs or to suffocate them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say, with the means of cause, because I myself, throughout my life, has abused.
But I'll tell you what happened to me.
One day, the first hospital in which I collaborated sent me to call and said to me, "But Zuckeli, here for her, there's no more place, if you like to continue the collapse with us, you have to accept a transfer."
And he told me a far away place, woke up, detesitated from the most, and above all, I would have to go there to make a job that didn't even enter a big deal with everything I had studied until then.
And I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, trying to change the idea, adopting them, but sending that other, and even less because I'd never had to accept a commitment that for me was unbearable.
I understood that...
But having different results would have had to do different things.
For the first time, of course, on my legs, at that moment, I realized that the secret, to change the others.
It's changing yourself, if it was changed me?
The others would also be able to follow, modify, change.
And if it was a super brilliant, competent, complete psychologist, the first one wouldn't send me via, if I hadn't done it, the thing wouldn't have taken me more than so.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
But the answer didn't go to the other's fault, but I had to introduce myself to the profound of my own.
Responsability.
But why things?
They don't change.
We are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do is in the direction of choosing ourselves.
Do you choose yourself as a cause of things?
That they don't go as they want.
You choose yourself as a cause of things that are not like you.
This is our bias.
But if I never find the work of the crisis, you're putting the only weapons to your disposal.
And now we'll find ourselves alone, in the hands, to face something too much bigger, I want to say, "It's the crisis's fault, what do you want to do?"
(Laughter) But if you're part of you, and you think you're perfect, that maybe there's a change mark, then you open doors in front of you, because it defends your responsibility, you make it, you can always decide to learn a new language, if you read books, to acquire new skills, to consolidate those who already have, you can work on TED to become unique.
Because life is who does it.
Who doesn't do it?
It's enough.
(Laughter) If inside the copy, things don't go well, you think it's the other to do the first step.
It's sending you a message of inequality, and you're moving away, if you're part of you.
And maybe your own contributions, every day, this simple question.
What can I do today differently to make your best day, then things change, but they don't change, but they change because you're you who're changed before going to the research of their lacks?
Now she's looking for her needs.
And then I try to operate to be able to satisfy them.
It's in this way that it creates a mental space inside which we can take care of one another instead of making the war.
I don't know if you're one of those people.
Those who are with everyone, who must always say, "Yes, one of those people I call, forgive me in the end, prostitute and relationship."
It's clear that you're not only losing time, but you also lose the sense of meaning, the things you do.
If you start with yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand which actions you put in the field to preserve them.
So the game becomes something, inside which you can become the standard of the table, and starting to work on me, considering things that didn't go as I wanted, instead of their simple effect, that I also started to have fun of being a better person.
When I was writing to the university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to understand them that, with my matter, there were practical tools, sometimes even fast to bring great value inside their lives.
But friends, I met with a couple of...
I'd like to talk to you about problems.
Stereotypes, prejudices, psychologist is the doctor of the matters, the psychologist is the doctor of the debts, but I had to talk to a friend, but I went to the park, but what should I do?
I had to lament myself, or possible that I didn't tell you how beautiful psychology I had to try to change their mental priority, I had to drop my dream.
No, I had to...
To learn to speak a language, which was the one who didn't happen, as the agent approached, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way.
I had to learn to listen to their needs.
Instead of imposing my own.
And, after a short time, following this direction, I got results for me, unimaginable.
When I finished the collapse with my primary and its transfer, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I didn't know what to do.
Audience: Yes.
I thought about it, and finally I decided.
I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as he understood him.
I'm transferred here.
I went home, I got the computer, and I registered a video I carried on YouTube, in which I spoke about psychology, here for the cronach, I say, to take a few lights, because maybe you think it's.
In a short time, my YouTube channel has become a reference point in Italy for what psychologists look at in video thanks to this thing every day thousands of people are approaching the psychology putting in discussions some of the stereotypes I mentioned before.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm in 79: I divide psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best schools in Italy, and I left my review.
I had to let myself down.
Because, obviously, they saw that my attempt to innovate the profession in a way to communicate it had something sense and in Lombardia I was read to the vice-president of the psychologist.
What a dream come true?
(Audience): Yes.
But they don't become reality because, fortunately, or because you've had that.
The theory you have to have is the one that supports, that makes you move forward, who doesn't know how you build and needs to distrugle yourself, because the cube should do it.
It's also so much to discuss your identity, your points of belonging to your certainties, your habits of always.
That's it.
What if there's something I learned from all this inner journey?
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but also the most urgent.
It must come to our internal life.
Ten minutes ago I asked you a question: if I had the chance to express a desire, one only to modify a aspect of your life that doesn't go like forests?
What would you change, have we talked about work, physical perspective, the current contact?
(Laughter) Well, in fact, I'd like to leave you with a gift, or at least try it, it's a small question that was personally very useful, and that is based on the logic that, to get to produce big changes, you have to focus on many small actions.
So, what's the smallest thing?
And easier.
What could you do until now, at the end of the afternoon, to return home after this beautiful day, and that will allow you to take the first step?
To put your life in the direction?
Here you're explaining.
You can think, what is the smallest, the simplest thing you can do to put your life in the direction?
Where do you live?
(Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
As you can see, I have your keys of the fridge to eat.
Or do you do it by yourselves, right?
They see, but where the bugs, the markets are the prove.
I said, "Oh Rotto la Pelle, I'm on your feet that it's time to change."
Of course, when my mother comes to me, do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to talk for eight minutes.
And I want to take this time by myself, here.
I had a dream.
To create an integration band.
In other words, diversity and diversity.
The percussions are so fast, so immediate, they take the distances and unite the battles.
Are we partners?
We're ready in seven.
You're young, I see them, I see Laura, Paola, Daniele.
I saw them grow.
Our tests were the marketing, the day of the test, where this stadium was entered in the Music of Andreoli.
We picked up the first bidons, we were together, the first waves together.
Then we decided to become a good mark, from there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical brands and travels: the first brands, the first brands in the pieces.
The first satisfaction, the first encounters.
The first satisfaction for the kids, for us, for everything we were doing.
But above all, the first applause.
Unfortunately, a night of the 20th of 2012, the world fell down.
And the real sense of the word.
All the cases were completely unbearable or crowned: a strong earthquake hidden, broken our earths.
And from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of the thousands.
For all the inequalities, we were called this.
As I said, the houses were no longer agible.
Many crossed: our proof, our place where we are.
Where there were all the markets, it was completely district.
And the tools were inside.
What did we do?
I, the Sahara, Marco, Fede, Matteo, we all looked for them.
In the bottles and in the roads.
Are we able?
Luckily, we found them all.
We've finished all of us inside a tender, in a tender, in the seventh of Middle East, of the end.
In that tenderness?
There are magnificent things.
We've seen fear sounding stronger.
Because the flag of the sound is stronger than the earthquake: we looked at ourselves in the eyes.
With the Earth that was shaking to look for a smile.
A look.
The Earth was shaking.
Inside that, we built the first tools.
The scary cests.
They became houses, tubes that became...
The tools built and suited with ping pong rocks, to remove them made with big houses, crowned.
We were constantly ...
In continuous work, always, there was an amazing energy.
Although we were at a terrible moment.
(Audience) Yes.
Our own leader was born in our first protocol.
We decided to put it on a real sponsor.
However, the group's components were increasing, the friends spent the word of 20 that we were, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We are part of the construction of the first protocol: the white.
Because there were the smallest loops, the biggest loops and the white genius.
At that moment, we all moved together as a blank of lights.
Then, immediately after that, we did...
Last year, we did the other sponsorship, the swarm.
We became all the Marines.
Because we really wanted to navigate and also move for a moment of our Earth.
To breathe for a moment.
Later, we made a crack, this marine monster, immediately afterwards.
50 speakers, this flywheel?
And to conclude, that of this year, the sea of the Moon, the sea of the Moon.
We wanted to close a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There were many things inside this tenderness, and none of us would never have thought that a tender could change life.
But we did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
What are the minutes finishing?
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems to me a favola.
Audience: Yes.
150 concerts spinning in Italy.
The first magician's stage?
The concert in the TV program at home.
Is it the lack of material?
We really made many of them.
And also to me, being forbidden, because this is precisely true.
It's exactly the scenery of life, the factory of the sweat, but also of the freshness.
That it's so much possibility to the future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality?
Now I have to come back from the flows, do you expect me?
Is there still so much?
To build, thank you all (Applause)
(Music)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause) One, two, three.
(Applause)
(Applause) You, three.
(Applause)
How are we going to do it?
My name is Maria Cristina Ferradini, and in fact I was born as a lawyer, until the moment I asked myself what happened in the last 250 years.
I'm ...
250 very important years that changed radically our history, and that we live today, we talk about social innovation, and my question is: What is this social innovation?
And above all, our Italy, which is often so biased, is a ready country to incorporate this digital innovation, and ready to be tested at the same time of innovation.
But this is the digital metaphor, we all take them to us, close to us, an object, I believe, almost everyone.
These three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new time, that we have, in some way, historically built arbitrally in the 2000s, and the computer evolved, and the computer belongs to the revolution of the Internet revolution that we are living today.
But let's try to understand then what happened in these 3 in these 250 years, that summarize them.
The industrial revolution, the Internet revolution and the Internet soldiers, the Industrial Revolution, when we remember it, we probably remember it as a Ferrovia.
What did we study to me?
I'm in the school's book, in fact, it wasn't just a iron, we, at the industrial revolution, are huge debates.
It's enormous debates, for example, because we need the vapor motor.
And the vapor motorcycle isn't just a vapor motorcycle, but, for example, that has favored, and it has resulted much faster, the United States of carbon, and has started to change the modality, but it doesn't make sense.
And we don't only have the motorcycle.
In vapor, we also need the scope motorcycle, because, on the other hand, it's an Italian invention, it's a scope.
We need, for example, the automobilistic industry.
In fact, before the Christmas industry, because the motorcycle was a motorcycle that couldn't start from fertile, when they were able to understand how to make that scent, to realize it as a fertile fuel, and it became that scent that has developed the automobilist industry.
But not only that.
In the Industrial Revolution, we are still in debates, for example, for the phone: the phone is not only with the tool that allowed us to avoid the migration of these letters from one part to the other of the world, always more than we knew.
But it's also what has allowed us, and it has taught us, to deposit the caves.
On the sea, and yes, because then there were tables, we couldn't try them in the sea, and then what we were doing, we interrupted everything.
No, we went forward, standing on the sea, and we went around 1858, the first cavity to give them a storal dimension was taken from Italy between medicine and the beach, not just two populations that came from agreement, but the first cavity was there.
There's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know what it is, we use it, brings it to our voice, in 187900 subscribed to Rome.
It's only 1877.
And there's another invention, and it's electric energy: the first electric center ...
Today, the Renaissance, there, a time in 1873 was built by the first continental Centrale.
In that year, on December 30th, the scale was lit.
A part of our history was born exactly there.
Let's move forward, let's try to make some more long salts, and we get to 1950: we try to make a certain ages, for another, it was a century of already grown, and it's getting to know a certain ages.
It's still in the course, but that has already lived important staffs, and also important emotions from a cultural point of view, but it begins to be born something, to compose something that has never been in the story before: they are the computer, which are calculators.
Three colors who, at the beginning of the '50s, could be in a stadium like this, and they had functions of neurocarcle: they simply read faster the calculation.
But they went forward and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors, they started to be the artificial intelligences we know.
But in these 50 years of the Internet revolution, something else happened, there were research institutions, and above all, there were scopes of all the defenses that have led to develop subterraneous reactions, but not underground, because they were not known.
And these challenges, called ARPA, ARPANET, the network.
They became and started to be the World Web that we know.
There was a diffused, or horizontal system, not hierarchical, extremely captured, capable of bringing information, in 1981 there were only 300 the computer connected to the Internet, in 1995 and there were 25 million.
Not many.
Today, it's in the orders of the dozens of billion, because we're not talking about the computers we use, but of all these intelligent systems that connect to the network to caricate data, to pick up data or to work data.
So, when the mechanical strength, which was, as I said, replaced by the industrial revolution.
It started to include the Artificial Intelligence of computers.
And mobility?
And this second, a phenomenon of creation, of creative destruction, which is called on the Internet, we've had the time we started to live the time we've lived now.
I'm essentially an industrial process that tells us that what is new progressively destroyed what is old, because we need to do space, and we'll see better how, but this is the story of great inventions that belongs to us a little more on which I try to accompany you.
When, little by little, the Italy hasn't made the Italians yet.
The Minister Mingetti, in the Finances of Inghet, establishes that the 27th of the Middle Ages, is corresponded to the payment and public dependents.
And from 27 to the next months that this happens, at this moment, even if we don't realize it, we're introducing something extraordinary: first the wealth of a family, more than a singer, was in their ability to produce good services that were necessary to their own support.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky of the stages, less risky of the elevation, it started in some way to move away from the Earth.
And above all, the economic power has transformed the power of goods and services in the power of production of one.
Well, the dwell.
But there's a second aspect, which is the fridge, and that it's not only the object that frees us from the emergency of going to spends every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to preserve, in a massive way, in a healthy way, in quantity of food.
So, there's the possibility, once again, to focus on something that isn't...
Immediately, the use of everyday life.
But this is the man who begins.
Living to the end of the 90s, these are us, in the time, as we said, arrived at the computer and arrived on the Internet, and then there's a figure that has characterized these years, there's an element that we can define as the qualifier of these years: speed.
We, 250 years ago, weren't fast as we are today, today we do the speed of the challenges, the speed of the movements, the speed of our movement, and also the speed of our thinking that is not said the quality of thinking, but we are very fast.
But when something happened?
It's typically close when you look at the story, to understand the passengers of a century to the other, and sharing data that are not necessarily zero.
In 1900 - 1900 - 2001, when we can say that the 20th century is finished, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary level that there are two data that are significantly segregated from a time to another, 2001 and 2008.
First of all.
The American economy started to slow down.
And on the other hand, there were Torri Gemelli, and so something in the equilibrium started to change, these balances that seemed solid, we realized that they were very fragile.
But we went forward until there was something that has slowed all the time, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world, and the oriental world together, had never met, there was no only America to have slowed, almost closed, there was also the orientation.
In other words, there were Europeans who were to fail, the Greece was already the leaves of failure, they don't talk to us, but still there, and changed something.
But what has changed, the economic paradigm has changed, we couldn't.
Don't wait for the biggest economic crisis.
Because in fact, if it was verified in 2008 it was crazy not to think about it, but how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension?
With many less people.
It was obvious that it would happen: we were old, we didn't know how to wait, look at these companies, these companies are stable multinationalities, in their majority, but above all, they are all companies that are Dante after 2011.
What did these companies do, don't they innovate?
inventing something, they didn't innovate building something that before there was, but they started doing what we've always done, buying, selling, learning, in a different way, in a more efficient way.
We're ten percentual points under the media, but, honestly, we're almost close to a fast connection for 50 percent, according to human resources, competences of curving it, of a different being, between advanced skills and basic skills on what allow us to flow.
The informatic systems of digital systems, those advances, those that allow us to develop them.
A third picture we have to look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it.
A third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of the digital factors in the productive processes.
So, comets, or industrialization of products and services, the fifth is digitalization.
The system of public administration: we immediately choose the field of some ambiguity, and we keep the only two that are important: above all, a good news for everyone, all the five elements are increased.
These are all the five minds that are in a growth, in a growth speed, completely in an attempt until two years ago, so we are letting European countries, and this is a good news.
On the other hand, with activity, we said it, it's ten dots outside, but, of course, it's enough to look at the newspapers, and you'll see that we're growing fast and competitive, very important, the use of internal, and we're really seconds to few.
In fact, a very profound change was born that is aligned to the European stadiums: there are two factors that we have to look at with great attention that will be key for our future of countries and are the skills and the inclusion of the digital in brutal factors.
And in this, we have to pay a lot of attention to the characteristics of our country, we have two engines, the first motorcycle.
It's what made the Italy in the '50s, it's the small businesses.
Long from being, the little media.
Something not useful, not effective, not paragonable to large multinationals, in fact.
I'm probably the most effective entrepreneurial tool to interceive the speed of change: they're agile, they're fast, they're small.
They know how to do something extraordinary that the Made in Italy has an excellence in the production of service, in the production of products, which is quite unique in their gender, everyone wants it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, competences inside these realities, because these realities can become those multinationals that can help.
A internal segment of the market, in an extraordinary way, generating wealth for the whole tissue that is around you: a heritage that, for her nature, for her natural nature, and this is the first assault that we have, the first great motorcycle, we can't digitalize the crop.
But is it possible that tourists visit only three cities?
Venezuela, Rome, and then they distribute.
I believe that this is the greatest urge to recover, to include this heritage inside a knowledge system that allows us to bring it to make it noise, and to bring tourism not only to visit three centers, but to visit all our country, thanks.
(Music)
(Applause) The topic I'm talking about in a certain sense is the opposite action of the word.
What does it mean?
And all this?
Our encounter is the opposite of the word "share," because I'll talk not about sharing, but in a certain sense of the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'll talk about inequality, and I'd like to start first.
With a question.
But if someone asked you?
In Brussia Pelo.
Secondly, in the last ones.
15, 20 years, we say, in the 21st century, inequalities in the world, the inequalities of law between the citizens of the world are increased or are decreased.
But I believe most of you will answer.
I'm increased, if you were the journalists, maybe you'll reach the precious goal, they've increased exponentially.
So, that's me.
I asked you, "But is it in Italy?"
Perhaps the answer of many would also be.
I asked myself these questions in the last few years, and with the only 24th and the foundation of video.
I was prepared with my colleagues, a report.
In inequalities, from when they are data, that is, financially, from 1960.
For the biggest majority of the countries in the world.
"Yes."
The result is what you see.
This is the curve of the disguised inequality between the citizens of the world, as you can see, there was indeed an increase of inequalities, especially in the 80s, but from now on.
From the end of the last century, in the end of the 90s.
And in Italy, comppressive inequality between the citizens of the world is crowned and precipitated, now we're at the least storage.
In Italy, as a result, inequality is quite complicated, even here we have an increase throughout the 80s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second Republic.
AC: We have a trend of decreasing inequality.
How can we read these data?
Well, a possible reading is to say, "We've traveled a collective bathroom because we've continued to talk about years of the increase of inequality, how much does it seem?
Data doesn't support our feeling.
And there's really, surely, in this reading, but we could also ask ourselves another question: What if the feeling of an increase of inequalities that many of us?
Let's do it!
It wasn't wrong the feeling, but it was wrong the idea of inequality on which ...
We think about it.
Perhaps?
We must reflect on the issue of inequality, on what we understand, for inequality.
Maybe the concept of inequality requires some rethink.
We leave this question temporary and we move around a century.
And also, we move to Cambridge in 1928, a year before the great Church of the 29th, Lickens.
It was Cambridge, there was a discourse in front of you.
It has a student audience, a speech became then famous with the title "The Economic possibilities for our grandchildren." In that occasion, Keynes forms two professions.
The first says.
It's a century, productivity.
After an hour working, it will be...
Other times the one of today is 1928.
And this trade, in fact, is made because if you went to take it.
The reconstructions of the stories of the economy.
Indeed, most of the advanced society, we have an increase of productivity in the turn of 100 years, which is also about...
Ten, 12 times, in some case, 15 times, so this teacher was fulfilled, but from this Keynes officer, there was also a consequence, an idea, which is humanity.
So, little by little, that is, it's been lost for a few years, it would be found with a huge amount.
The free time that would have it to...
To work less?
And he also said, "Let's work everyone," and when he said less, he understood a week of 15 hours of work.
I have a three-hour work time a day.
And he saw a problem for this, because the question that was asked Keynes, but with all this free time we knew how to use it well or not.
Well, that's it.
Apparently, this second orphysics hasn't been done.
Because we all see it, that we don't all work, and it doesn't seem exactly what we work three hours a day.
But what about me?
I'll show you that this profession is divided in two parts: there's one that says we all work, it's certainly false, but the first part.
We'll work a lot less, we'll work three hours a day, we're sure it's not done anywhere, we'll see what happened in Italy.
That's it.
This curve, this trajectory, represents the fraction of time.
It's an Italian, medium.
It dedicates the work in the course of your life.
Your life, naturally, is potentially working, that is, from the age of 15.
We are able to compare a job, well, if we look at this trajectory, the prophecy of Keynes is actually made.
Because we were at the beginning of 900, almost 40% of our lives' time.
To work?
And now?
We call it around 16% and the interesting thing is that this 16% ...
"Fa."
Two hours and a fourth a day, that is, the barrier of the three hours, in Italy, we've already collapsed it.
Now, what does it mean?
If this happened, there are also reasons.
Obviously, if you want banals, for example, the old age is enormously aligned.
Because we die very much after the life expectancy, and those who were able to do something like 27 years from the beginning of the last century, from 900, there's another very positive reason: and other children often study, study long.
It also studies us, even at 25 and 30 years old, so even young age has been aligned.
But there's a reason, perhaps more fundamental, for which ...
Our quote of time?
Dedicated to work and crowned.
And it's the crop of the occupation rate, that is, the number of people who work.
This is the historical series of total occupation.
It's built for this occasion.
And this series is dramatic, because it makes you see.
Okay.
At the beginning of the century, in all monarchical era.
Before the Second World War, the occupation rate was even better than 70%.
Today we're very low, we're around 50 percent scarce, old, from 1968 and around a year.
The occupation rate has always been inferior to 50%.
But is it a step of occupation?
In fact, 50 percent.
What does it mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, who don't work, that is, pure consumers who don't perceive any network.
There are more workers.
In front of this?
In fact, storal, we can also have a reaction.
It's enthusiastic and say, "But what does this mean?
And progress, beauty, is modernity.
Things went like this because we can allow it.
But then let's see if, in the country that the problem of modernity, that is in the United States, things have been in the same way, because if this interpretation is fair, it should have also happened in the United States.
So, let's see the confrontation.
Let's go.
Italy.
You were united.
This is the storal series of time.
It's dedicated to work in life, as you can see, and the United States only waves up to the '30s, then it's established, but it's a reading tendency to the increase while we crash.
But even more impressive, it's the storal series of the occupation rate.
Because here we see.
Because even there's an increase, that small one you see below is the crisis of 29: we have a general tendency of the occupation rate in the United States.
At the increase, instead, in our case, we have a situation.
The reduction.
It's the occupation task.
But then, this ...
In Italy, it's a pathology.
It's not normal.
Why? Because we don't know
But there are more people who consume without producing than the people who produce.
It's not normal that the majority of the population lives in a condition that I'll define.
"Dipendency parassitary," "dependence," because it depends on the right to your judgment.
This tube can also be a family, the State.
But why do I consume it?
I have the right to work without working.
I'm a friend who does theater, when I found these results.
We were in the scene and I asked them.
You, as you've been interested in this situation with an image, in a situation of parasitary dependency, and you know what has happened to me.
With the hypothesis, is that lights?
It lives on the sphere of the hypothesis, but it's called buffagon, some say buffaga, here it is.
If you want to have an idea of how you behave.
The bubble or the bubble on the prototype, or on the other big mammals, and these fish also live on the broken rivers, on the bubbles, well, we have this thread.
What will interest us for a few seconds, in which you see?
"Yes."
These fish, these birds.
How do they live?
Speaking of the resources.
The bubble provides it, which are insects, larvae, ze that everything that albergs on the bubble, isn't clear if the bubble is contained by the light bulb.
Anyway, that's it.
This is what happens in nature, but I'm not an ethology, I do the sociologist, so the question I asked myself as a sociologist.
It's another: How can we define a situation of this kind, how do we define a society where there's a majority of pure consumers?
It's a minority of producers, as we define a society in which ...
There's this kind of productive consumption, the first one, there for them, said to me, "But this is the ignorant society?"
Society, gentlemen, like the feudal society, in which there's a ceiling.
What has put in the condition of living without working?
But, naturally, it's not enough: you have to add a qualification, this is indeed a condition.
It could be defined by ignorant society, but it's a mass society.
(Audience) Yes!
Because consumers are more producers.
In the Mr. Ide society, it's simple, classic: we have the gentleman and the jungle serves that produce for him, in society.
And here the report is clear: it's a relationship of commanding and subtomission, in the ignorant society of mass.
Things are a little more complicated: gentlemen, they became many.
The relationship between signals and producers is much more complicated: Greek Dubezon, a great psychologist and psychologist, would have defined it a relationship of Oppio Legame, we see why.
The relationship?
From bubble with the hypothesis, and from parasitism, and this is a advantage signed in green, but it's also dependence, because it depends on food that is there.
On the sphere of the hypothesis: the red light indicates a disadvantage.
And also from the point of view of the producers, we have again a red fresh, a green fresh, the autonomous hypothesis doesn't need the bubble.
But it's somehow in an obligation report, how are we?
In the colors we maintain, because we can't, we can't, we can't nourish the fish that live.
On its sphere, so the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of legacy, but a situation ...
That's not fine.
Is it a situation in which?
That's it!
A new problem of inequality, and now we get there.
The question I had asked about Keynes: today, perhaps, the real inequality and the inequality of access to work?
The access to work is very similar to our social system, but if inequality is access to work, we can use the tools.
In the analysis of inequality, that is, calculating an efficient concentration of genius, which is the tool with which inequality can apply it to work: there are people who don't work, who have a job, who have two jobs.
And the position of the History, in this scale of inequality of access to work, is dramatic: the position of the History is ...
There's a series.
And there's the last one in the graduation together.
She's Turkey?
The country in which inequality reaches the maximum, but simply because there's the exclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, we would probably have the palm of this creator, the best situation, that of the northwest.
With the United States, I was in the middle.
They need us to become an Oxis country, normal, seven million jobs.
How did we get to this, this is the story?
For the inequality of access to work in Italy, it's always measured in any efficient decades, you can see something clamorous that inequality is minimal during the monarchical age, especially in the second public that we live in.
They would perceive it.
1,000 euro a month, in more, we would have 12,000 euros of round, in more.
At the year?
And our state would have 150 billion euros to spend as much as the health of the school has put together, more or less in Italy, but here there's a word.
Nights.
We have the scholarship to write in the first article of the Constitution, "The Italy is a democratic Republic based on work, we are the only country."
It has this in the first title of the Constitution, and we are the worst country together with the Turkey of the West.
That's why.
Or we change things.
And we create the seven million jobs that miss, or maybe better to cancel the article one of the Constitution.
Because, being so, things sound like a beer.
Thank you (Applause)
