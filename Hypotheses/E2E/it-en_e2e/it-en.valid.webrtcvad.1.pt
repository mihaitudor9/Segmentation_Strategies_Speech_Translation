Well, in 2016, I was given a award: from the National Forum Forticing Learning, supported by the Ministry of the United States in Irlanda, from the name a little particular, they were born in Chiro.
The motivation of this award was my availability in the confrontation of the students and my ability to create data environments.
Less formal, more relaxing, let's imagine that this is a big university class.
So, usually, I go to class.
The first ten minutes, when students enter and get there.
I put my computer to explain and put a classic music, I think this is the first step to create less forming data environments and try to maintain the attention of the students.
Unfortunately, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a method used after the anxiety.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, the storytelling is a method based on the use of narratives.
To transmit knowledge to students, and just with this method I'd like to start my lesson explaining to you to describe a topic about everyone's mouth.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that children tell, I'd like to start my story.
There was once.
Second World War.
1942, a nest.
Blockchain Park.
A northern residence of London.
There was a young and 30 years old.
Alan Turing.
Let's move there, now, to those in Cambridge's schools, and they have a research doctor in logic, the Princeton University in America.
At that time, the Tedes used a machine.
Special.
It's enigma.
It was like a writing machine.
The Tedests used this mechanism to communicate digitally under the machine: those letters, I stuck other letters, according to a code imposed mechanically under the machine.
But anyone would interceive this paper in front of you without any sense.
It was shouting.
(Audience) Yes.
Alan Turing was one of the main paintings in Black Park.
Take a look and build them a machine.
What can you see?
In other words, in order to decipher ...
This test is written by the Tedesque.
For this invention, we think that war is finished with two years of anticipation.
It's saving many human quickly.
Alan Turing continues, after the war, to do its logical research.
And it's considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
I don't know.
With your Turing machine, he formalizes the concept of computer, even before the computer was created in practice.
In 1950, an article published on the "Mind magazine."
"Computing Machines and Intelligence."
Where do you propose the test?
The question behind the testing is a very precise one.
They can think machines.
From here on, artificial intelligence began.
Probably many of you have seen the movie of Emitation Game, the game of limitation, I want to explain to you.
Let's suppose there's a person here?
It's said to be the computer.
That asks questions and on the other hand of the end, a machine M is an operator O.
In an alternative way, the machine M and the speaker or form the answers to the person standing.
It's said that the machine takes over the Turing test if the person is not able to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the operator.
This is limiting a game.
The machine must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
You must interpret the natural language.
The question that comes from the person must represent knowledge to form the answers.
It must think in an automatic way to form these answers.
And it must learn automatically.
(Audience) Yes.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence.
One of these is the cognitive approach.
Audience: Yes.
It's based on human thinking.
(Applause)
According to this process, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to capture thinking.
In the moment they are born.
Or we try to modify the thinking at a psychological level.
That's why artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive neural sciences and psychology.
According to this approach, the assignment that if we can really have a female representation of human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of the laws of rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man?
All the men are mortal.
Socrates are mortal.
This is a deductive argument.
According to two primary legs, from here the logic of the doubt is born, according to the approach of the laws of the thought, a real conclusion is reduced.
It's trying to build educational arguments and turn them into a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational agents.
A rational agent, an entity.
So it must act.
It must be adapted to the context.
And it must be carried out goals, and know how to take them to end.
And it must act in a rational way.
So Test Duturin is linked to intelligent people.
Riformulating the phrase of Turing can a machine think.
We can say, "Can we create a machine?"
An artificial agent.
I invite you to think.
To exhibit intelligence and rationality.
(Audience) Yes.
Artificial intelligence, so it's at the purpose of creating artificial entities, intelligent, your phone is an entity.
Among the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence as psychological construct.
Once we have more knowledge.
What about this?
What's the point?
It's close to build artificial, intelligent identity and supported by humans.
It's a title.
But let's see today.
If machines can think.
I'd like to explain to you to describe the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I'd like to use.
Five classes to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We have subtle agents.
Stop human beings.
We have human beings, and finally we have optimal agents.
I want to explain to you with some examples: optimal agents are the people who act better than all men and can't do better.
For example, people who used the cube of Rubik play a four-year-old strength in the best way, play a sad, think that a few years ago a young man has rescued.
It was the beginning of the Rubik cube, it has resolved it in 4.73 seconds.
A few months ago, they created an agent, a robot that was able to solve in zero.63 seconds.
Do we have the sovereign agents?
Do you agree better than all people?
For example, in the game of the rocks.
In the game of the scarce.
A few years ago, the Russian Scake campaign was killed by an artificial agent.
We have the sovereign agents, the ones that exist almost like all people, for example, in the Power Texano game, to answer the question of the ketchu.
We have teeth for the man.
What do they act?
Almost like all people.
For example, I have the classification of objects in cognitive activities like the crowned words, and finally we have subtle people who manage the worst of all people, examples are the classification of objects.
The recognition of calligraphy, the vocal recognition, the translation of a language to the other.
But if there's something that artificial agents, today, are not able to do, for example, is a disambiguation: we're talking about the result.
How is it?
The mum.
Or are we talking about the mark of the body Apple?
And one thing that agents are not able to do is reasoning in the ideal world, in uncertainty situations.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence, so you think we are far from overcoming the test.
But let's see now in the future.
They will be able to think the machines.
A few years ago, in America, a thing was introduced by the name of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest experts in artificial intelligence in the world.
Imagine the time line.
Imagine a line that indicates the human intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a red line that indicates the machine intelligence with an exponential environment.
This sleep follows the previous environment in the wall's laws, so the computer complexity, for example, measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, radiated for two years and in four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to...
It's the use of this computer complexity to stimulate the human brain.
I didn't see anything.
In 2020 we would have access to 1,000 dolls to this computer capacity.
In 2025, secondary and crossed, I'll never be able to get rid of our brain in a precise way.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will pass the test, they will overcome the test.
And then, in 2045, and the indication, the moment in which technology singularity will have.
In which machines will follow the intelligence of the machines will follow an exponential environment that will radically change human intelligence.
In his article.
It's published on the Mind magazine.
The tourists don't only proposed their tests, but they also propose new objections against their same test.
These objections are us against artificial intelligence.
But a few years ago?
The student at the University of Varese followed a course of ethical ethology and ethics of computer science, had by the Gaithan professor Aurélio Lanzerone, one of the compounds we had to develop was to propose a decent formulated communication with mathematical intelligence.
OK, what about human stupidity?
It's the desire to describe in simple terminals: let's suppose to take the intelligence of all people?
To put the seed, the symbol of submission to the minister side of the equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
So we get an intelligence equality, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were us?
To transfer our intelligence inside a machine.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we left the machine become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story?
Let's ask myself to the initial question: can machines think?
I'd like to leave you.
With an open question.
Thank you very much.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you (Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Good afternoon... (Applause) How many of you today have taken pictures?
OK, well, this gives me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in the bathroom, I've spent the last three years in these three years and that I'm interested in sharing with you, I'm the creative director of a study that takes care of photography, which is the photographer, which changes the product and changes through which we communicate.
In order to find answers to these questions, I've tried to open a confrontation with photo-Editer, careers, critical and theorists who, in the midst of the photographer, have had a new language in order to develop experiences and reflections, I've asked them to share with me the anatomy of their projects.
To find answers, I looked around and arrived in New York, at the DSC of the New York Times Megers in Cathy Ryan.
In Berlin, in the AIM sede, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock.
In Parigi, in the rooms of Parifot, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world, to enter those places in which photography is distributed, it's based on the contemporary places.
For example, selfie, the selfie to get involved, simply to a delirium narcissistic, like some sociologists have sustained with the body dismorphism of body dismorphism, and to put themselves in connection like some psychologists who have been seen as an occupational healthcare of the generation of the millennials, as "Key d'Aard Ben".
Or the Asho Rager, the phyto-pintage aesthetics that has still segregated our mobile vision.
This is my dog, Zazi, a victim designed by my photographic experiments, and it's simply the result of a world's world's worldwide epidemic, or, instead, as it has sustained the social and historical social society, even economical, but photography is not the territory of answers, of this phenomenon I've tried to give an interpretation in a book.
It's called "Revolution," I mean, for a story of the photographer, because in front of the excessing image we're exposed, it seems to me to try to draw a map, if not to find the route, at least to understand what we are.
And as we say, the story of the photographer is short, but in a few years I've invented millions and millions of people, a new code that exceeds every linguistic barrier, used daily to communicate, to manifest themselves, to feed a constant flow of images that make individuals from an angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collective monument, if you want, that has impressive numbers: every two minutes, today, we take more images of how many humanicans have taken in the interaction of the last century.
More than 350 million of these images are carried every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production and the diffusion of images, of activities that, until a few years ago, looked at a research collection of professionals, became a instinct of our private sphere in the public dimension.
In which we define ourselves through the images we produce, or better, we exist because we produce images.
And if the photographer is a new language, then it's the mother's family, the coppy, they're always more fascinating, and here actors are unstablished points in a universe in movement, sponsorship, which seems the form of more natural expression, a liquid expression that complies and complies.
On the one hand, the facility of using the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of existing and conscious photographs, but in a world where each one, at any moment, can record any event, the universal language.
Forting to fulfill that process of democratization of photography, I started with Lera Kodak and arrived until the iPhone.
On the other hand, the use of the cell phone as a reference tool offered to professional photographers, new possibilities in approach to the stories, to the contents, to the subjects.
Still, on one hand, the opening to all of us, of a dialogue ending, with a powerful tool to orient the public opinion and a potentially global science based on the rule that the photographer and social network has dedicated to the rule of the photographer in the first Arabic, on the other hand.
And it has allowed them to put themselves directly into the use of the newspapers, a Instagram photographer based on a American photographer, Rayce, Courniz, and dedicated it to the preservation of the universal heritage of the T-COber's Fotographic Fotography, which, in the last few years, has operated the photographer and the photographer of the LED.
Benjamin Lowi.
"Orona Vive," who have used and use the smartphone in conflict territories, showing how agility and the description of the means can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of depth.
It's a photographer that belongs to a simple smartphone has explored new paths for Newsmaking, creating a well-being platform to put in touch the American soldiers in the south of Afghanistan with their families, and to create such a motor of information from the front of the first hand.
Bred Mengin, who used it for sport photography, exclusive territory of photographers with hyper-performant appearances, and made a beautiful narration of intimate narration on the best League of Baycebol.
Research Cirnandt, who enjoyed the discretion and manner for the photographer, creating a very personalistic aesthetics.
I'll tell you that it made me a little bit of denouncement, going back to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, and creating a community that attacks the parts around its work.
MTIX that uses it daily to build its family album, inerting a reflection on how Instagram changes the facts of our privacy, and the way we build and preserve our visual memory.
Peter of Campo, who, through the African Countain, has shown how the photographer, far from limiting simply to generate visual cliches, can also be used to discuss the Western stereotypes on the crisis and the fame, has shown to the story of a daily Africa.
Like Stephan of Luigi who interpreted the Omer's story with the cell phone, telling in the AI series, one of the oldest heritage in the history of the West, with the new vision tool.
Or as I was born in Lourlin, who photographed the manifestants in Piazza, who, during the protests of Mai-Tan, with a beautiful poetry, and contemporary scholarship, well, what do we know how to do these photographs?
To tell, going to the outskirts of action, or looking for personalistic tags on the event, to design in a deep interaction between photographer and subject, to contaminate the code of the storytelling, designing differently and reaching different audience.
To make network using the connections in an innovative way.
Putting on the authority exercise for its point of view on the world and the quality of deepness, because anybody is the tool of rewarding and smiling, articulated in a powerful way.
It can be distinguished from the visible rumor of the bottom that offers us the eyes.
All of this, I believe, makes the difference between a photograph that is, "My memory of the real, its bullying, reproduction, its self-reference and sharing, and a photography that can still be a cultural metaphor.
Thank you all (Applause)
(Music) (Applause)
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
What we believe is to be silence, in fact, are 50 parts of the electric race.
50 Earths that are immediately entered in our lives.
We wake up from the illusion that silence exists.
I don't exist to myself.
So also in this room, those providers, these seeds, and put a 50-heres day, then you imagine yourself, not, go home after a work day, really stressful.
There's always her, this frequency of 50 herds, that I simply increased volume: eat with your partner, with your partner, except and then you'll have read in the bubble of your bedera and think you're alone.
Because it's imperceptible in our homes, in our lives, but it's more or less this sound.
(Music)
But we have a positive perspective: or better, first of the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist, but we have a positive aspect.
We're never alone, that is, always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us, really, paranoid.
And if we look at it as a drawing, this frequency of 50 times is nothing more than a sound wave, a wave is now with a beautiful rich spectrum, with which we can make music, and then I'm asked, "But why not make us music?"
So, I'm a composer of sound colonies, an artist, I'm an hour, or a little particular, because I've complicated my life deciding to make music alone and exclusively through rumor.
My parents divorced when I was a child, and I know you think this is the classic story in Strappalacre, but, instead, it was the revelation of my life, so every complement of the network was no longer the weight of that house, I started to make music with all that surrounds you.
(Applause) Of course, a classic complement of the network, we were immobile, full of voices, but it becomes my musical tool: with an ampage between the other of my mom, I was looking at myself from the streaming, and this is a great thank you.
Of course, I say, at some point...
I'm sure you're going to become a normal person, trying to say, "I've tried because I started studying Chitarra."
Then I liked Woody Allen, so I started to stop Clarinetto, the problem I really liked Arenzo Arbord, who wrote a beautiful song in Bigoa.
I didn't even abandon Clarinetto.
And that's how, to not give easy illusions to my classmates.
But why did I abandon all this, why did I study and escape from that notation so rigid?
Because there's more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more sponsor in a rumor, and I like to paragonate it to the problems of life.
We all attacked a rumor, a failure, something that made us think, but I'm sure that that that that rumor made us grow much more.
So it's a smile, that's why my mission ...
So when I'm a child, it's to transform a failure, a rumor in music, and to harmonize everything around me.
"Thank you."
Do you have it?
I'll have everything, right?
I say, "Let's make a beautiful turning point of dollar, Gino Paoli," and everything would be concluded, but no, I'm complicated in this way life.
What is sound?
But above all...
What is the study, and with the saying, is one of the most difficult senses to understand, but also the most immediate, the most powerful.
To transmit an emotion: our internal eye, the protein of the oceans, our team, reaches the maximum functionality around the fifth week of gesture.
This is not a case, I say the fifth week of gesture, this means that we start to listen even before talking, we start to listen even before seeing.
Because the fact must be ready.
I know that the sponsor in life, once born, must be ready to the northern texture, it shouldn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So, in a case, if the mother, during the pregnancy, listened to Pancroco British, doesn't have to stupid if the child, once was born, will be sleeping, listening, for example, Sex Pistols, OK ... (Applause)
But what is sound: sound is everything we're surrounded, sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
Audience: Yes!
It's what, in our lives, is completely abstract.
You don't see yourself, you don't touch me, the colony is time for every day, the rhythm in our partner, the mother who screams us, because the mother screams us anyway.
All of this is the sound colony of our days and, of course, the visual is much easier.
We don't know.
The visual is when we get to the assistant's hair, we say.
It's smaller than how I imagined them.
There's more small than the man of Milan, smaller than San Pietro, smaller than your house, maybe?
(Laughter)
And you understand the same thing as when a person sees me in video, or on stage, and then I tell you a person, and says to me, "I imagined higher, well, of course, because it would be really impossible, so ...
Going from this budget, the visual ...
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
(Audience) Yes!
Let's imagine our lives, I'd like to genuine your ability to observe, so we're in vacation.
We're in the sea, not in case, and we start a soccer blog, then there's the open aircraft, so we call a drone to take a photo of the drunk, then it's a photo from the bottom, we don't do it, but we also talk about food, kilometers, kilometers, kilometers don't sound, I don't know, I't know, I't know, I't have a lot of money, but it, but it's a lot of sensory, but a lot of food, a lot of food, and nobody eating the doll.
We photograph it, we look at it.
We make many videos, but we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I teach you a trick: when do you get them with someone?
The best moment to know the person is to stay in silence, that silence that, among the other, doesn't exist: bathrooms, and...
Listen, close and listen.
Like in this moment.
Let's go.
So, today I'd like to take you with me, I'd like to bring you with me?
I'd like to start by telling you about the world, genuine your perception of listening and I'd like to start by telling you.
The dream of my life, the dream of my life that is born from the listening of myself.
For the first time, the listening of myself was 2013, I wanted to run away from the History, a series of failures, problems and others.
So, I decided to choose ...
A city on the Atlantic.
There was the Atlantis, and it's true, there was still a lot of fear: I had an idea, but I was only listening to the city, I decided to participate in a great musical tool, and it was the one that would have listened to the sounds of all the world, of all the cities in the world, creating this project "Sound of the city."
And I created a sound colony.
So, at this moment...
I want to sound, Shanghai.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Video) (English) In Ivo Badão, I'm experiencing that I'm the only one in the countryside, in Ivo Badão Caio, I'm going to inspire you.
(Video) (English) In my heart, I'm going to be the most specialist in the wind.
(Video) (English) (English) Hi, I'm a young man, I'm a young man, I'm a young man, I'm a young man, I'm a young man, I'm a young man, I'm a little old man.
(Music) (Applause) But I saw you all, you were still focused on the visual, and this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say that it's a test, it's all collected to the visual.
Now.
There's a city that is sure, you've photographed, in every way, and you're asked more than once, but that smoke that comes from the tombs that are done, but the bridge of Brookly is an exceptional exilephon, completely in leg.
And I want to add it to the top.
(Making drum-like sounds) (Making drum-like sounds) (Music) (Music) (Applause) I think of the singer that is really cold on the side and something important to say.
It's beautiful, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because on the other side of the world.
It's not magical because it's on the other hand, it's magical because under our eyes every day.
And maybe many of you know a pair of places.
In this picture...
The sound rule is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, going around a city, losing yourself in the same city, well, I knew Genova.
I knew Genova, because there were many times, there were absolutely captured many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and I've started to record the first sounds.
(Music) And I like a bit - I've always done it so normal - I've never been - I've attacked this beautiful man, and I've reproduced a very low frequency that has become a synthesiser.
(Music) His name is Laborato.
Of course, Genova is "Morzandis" (Laughter) And it wasn't a battle, this is a serious thing.
Let's give a moment.
The writing, which you see constantly in the pity of Ferrari, is not just a writer, for me it's a great musical tool, and helped me to support the sound's beat, and it's more or less like that.
(Music) The last sound, after I really want to sound like Genova, is that of...
All the doors of the port.
That we are used to look at it, but the sound is a perception that is opposed to the view, and so I created this microphone, I immersed it for 48 hours.
In Genova's port, I found a sound of a track that gave me a particular frequency that became melody and when it became the melody, it's because putting it in the loop is transformed in what the voice of the colony is gold.
(Sounds) This is its rock.
(Music)
(Audience) Yes!
It's true.
Well, now I'd like to make you feel good, but I've come to this point, "No."
Here's Genova as a sound.
(Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music)
(Applause) Okay.
Now, do you feel this?
Do you feel this sound?
(Applause) Any sound of our passions in my and your own, and for how many people will tell you that they're rumorous, stuck out of time, you really want to listen to them, and I'll always bring you to school, thank you.
(Applause)
As it's said Guybek in Italian, the word generally used is restitution, it's not perfect, but the idea of the idea, in generating the idea of restitution linked to monetary institution to the benefit.
Many times, instead, the restitution is related to restricting what you did, what you learned.
And going from the end of the '90s, in 1999 precisely, this is my son's ages, and going from the end of the '90s, then in Italy it doesn't work anything in this country, we try it, so the next 18 minutes shared some sponsors of this story.
At the same time, my monkey organized the funds collection to pay the material.
From the asylum, it's an activity.
Very heavy, made with many parents, some of them said, "No, why should we help, we must think about the common state, but most of them make these extraordinary efforts?"
To help the asylum, to help the community, it collected a million 200,000 readers, because they don't remember 600 euros from then on, and it was one of the efforts of individuals in an extraordinary effort.
A few months later, we take the United States, this is...
It's similar: the same scenario for a nearby school, and this is the biggest children.
And there's a completely different reality, which was extraordinary for us, we realize that it's a totally extraordinary reality.
In other words, the thing of the game Beck of the restitution is very normal.
So the extraordinary effort of an Italian genital is ordinary for all that society.
Not that the American society is perfect.
So much, I said, "This is the thing of restitution, I've had fortune, I rest, I help school."
The university helped the university, helped the museum, the the the the the theater, there are all the communities, financially, live of fishing rejections, there are processes.
It doesn't work, it's not based on this.
I'm ten years old, some of you may have known it, this is the south's launch.
It has the support of the famous Obama Ker, "The Miss Done System is the moment."
Trump is trying us very actively to ask ourselves "Systems of one of the moment," Obama Lancer famoso Bamacchier was an incredible technological debate.
The technological launch has spilled 100 million dolls, so don't worry about these things didn't happen only in Italy, they build a sid that doesn't work so many million contacts, and this is the standing answer they received.
In short, criticizing not finishing for a few days, but then someone stopped criticizing, and it's enough to do it.
Going from criticizing, which is easy and normal to try to do and help, which is difficult, extraordinary.
This is us, it's not a common thing.
This is Time Magazine's coverage.
Refigure the experts of technologies sent by Google and other companies, they were offered, and I agree with the Bianca house, I didn't have the kitchen, I put it in the session, I stayed in a few weeks, at a decim of the costs.
After all, many would have criticized, but I'm surely interested in this.
Audience: Yes.
The extraordinary effort, and not the ordinary, I've seen that I've finished in the TAMEGS, was very interesting, and that's what...
I want to explain to them how they were spinning, or even more.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this validity, this bag, and they decided to reproduce the experiences that had filled their lives.
In this case, what can we do?
They look at the ability to manage big technological systems, complex, unbearable processes.
Repetible, to make them again replicable, and to create a replicable system, which is the USA, this effort, then was born.
A replicable system, what we hope to do with us, I want to talk about the word model, because one also implies the models, which were the help of our lives that inspired us and taught us.
Those who have taught you perseverance, the desire to never move, to continue to insist, energy, empathy.
So these are the models that are part of this bag that we have to use, we want to reproduce.
But for me, obviously, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also the factor: Italy.
Almost 30 years ago from the History, the idea of helping was also because I'm Italian.
What about it?
I wanted to do it right now: Do you want to know what it is?
To do or not do, there's no attempt, maybe the Italian thing is to do or not do, there's only to criticize.
Audience: Yes!
A few years later, we are five to the San Francisco Material and the Visica Avenue to Silicon Valley reins the sensitive need for the transformation in general.
Some things get stuck a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of the processes and the digital transformation of the public administration requires me, because it doesn't come to help us in Italy for a couple of years, I think it's reflected in my wife's pavement, Monica, and I talk to my genius, to get the brief, I decided to have tried it and I didn't get it, or I don't get it.
The choice was made, and so it's been sent to the Rome for two years.
A topic of...
(Laughter) Ah, Amazon!
But those who have to do it, Molina Amazon, Probono, Saymato, but that's what will give you underwater, these are only many phrases, I have to say that we've also received so much support, so at this moment we're focusing on this part, but in a positive part there was.
(Laughter) I was mentally preparing for skepticism and bureaucracy to people ask me, "But do you expect this bureaucracy, and yes, I didn't expect it, of course?"
But the scientist must have often cynicism that characterizes a certain mentality, will never do it, of course, because you don't have rights, I've heard a lot of this kind.
In this country, in fact, the sense of common good lacks a lot.
To do things because you think you're helping to improve a situation not only because it's not interested.
And here's it, for the days of you, this is a commissioner, for the most elderly you recognize it, as a extraordinary commission, and simply because it's their rule that allowed me to be able to take people from the public administration.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is: how do the systems from inside don't become, do we want to try to transform them with people who come from outside, where the fact that they don't know the public administration?
It's an asset.
So, financially, we created a small team, I wanted it to be a small team, I told you 25 people, a new one.
It's not big, but it's also too small: technological experts around 80% are expected to do legal, legal, governative, communication.
Here you can see the post I had done when, by myself, I started this adventure, I said, because we don't write what I think will happen.
In this way, we want to attract talents, talents that you live in Italy, or that you want to come back.
Also temporary, it has a very well-being compensation of what you see, as I'm convinced of you.
So I've put myself in the idea, but how do I convince someone to do the same thing I'm doing myself, in the other way some of you recognize it, that photography of the mining of the beautiful, that in the '47s, all the United States, all the United States, in this massive sport, of my investments and infrastructure?
(Audience): Yes.
We created the vision that the operative system of the country is a series of fundamental components to build simpler services, effective for citizens, public administration and companies.
But through innovative digital products.
It's a very beautiful vision in the documentary: it's the blood and blood.
I continued in my place: soccer field in Salita, since the American soccer, if I don't make mistakes.
And I continued, we will also have many rules, complicated, sometimes incomprehensible, it's a easy prediction: we should learn to manage with intelligence and bureaucracy, many will say, don't understand how a public works in an illustration.
They've already talked about it in many, they've failed, in Italy it doesn't work like that.
And we will continue, we'll get many criticisms: some comments will be useful, others will be cinemas and prejudices.
The criticisms of the first type will make people who want to really offer their contribution, and we've found a lot of them.
The second type of color they want to defend the state of the school is that they always see the bubble in the middle.
Or that, simplerly, the helplessness is drawn.
And this is our problem: to teach things that don't work.
(Audience) Good evening.
Remember this image: the first, men and women on the cover of Time Magazin.
Here we have here, so despite trying to scor the most possible people to do with the eye, I've received about three,000 questions.
So, certainly, at least a centimeter, decently qualified, we've used digital tours for the Colloqui, an app called Jazz, we have it in the middle of the government, we've made a mathematical test, a technological part, the team has reached the mass of the genius, and now we're a little more alive, and has immediately started to operate, what do we do?
(Laughter) In fact, we take care of Draulica.
These are the tubes of the public administration, some of them to do a lot to connect, because it's a big problem.
What is it?
The systems, the processes, the applications, anything that should be interconnected, is "asylos" and doesn't connect.
(Audience) Yes!
And I'm not only talking about machismo, I'm also talking about interruptability connectivity, and I'm not only talking about people who don't want to explore their own data, their own applications.
And sponsoring the code of the public administration, the emergency of the software, of course, is to do many projects activities, so many hydraulic activities.
But we can't also be pictures: to make the help of the beach, in time, you have to do them improving the interference of the most simple, all these things are made in parallel, but without the tubes, you can't do the pepper.
(Audience) Yes!
After a few months, in the midst of 2017 we wrote the piano "Trienna" by the Administration Transformation, we did together with the AGI of other people who helped us, what does a thing exist?
Two are written in a clear, technological way, but also in the process.
For the first time, it was assessed and sponsorized by the government, the triennal piano requires a game of square to simplify the public administration, the city of the citizen, particularity of the piano.
It's been newspaper once a year, because the pieces can't be static, especially in technology.
And this is appreciated to administrations, this is the only way to make the pieces in Italy, in the public administration.
But, unfortunately, we can't fly these things, but we can talk to the administrators, the researchers, the technology of you understand it, it's replicating the technical rules and read them from other norms to another ego, and at some point, there are technological rules that are quite uncomfortable software.
That's why I had to improve it.
If we dedicate ourselves to this moment, particularly, and this is always a part of the piano, to the agitating platforms, which are the digital platforms, they are the things that enhance all the activities of the public administration, the more there will be.
The digital payment is one: the electronic card, the electronic letter, which is a big platform, the identity of digitalizing a platform.
The greatest project we've followed is called the national and resilient population.
"Yes."
Putting this, banalizing technologically, all the data of you, citizens, who, at this moment, are at 8,000 different styles, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, the only Database, are synchronous.
Where data is talked about them, especially synchronized, and they talk to the rest of apps of the administration: when I transfer to a common to the other, I have to...
First of all, I was managing, manually, then I have to go to the island, to motorization, to all those places, I have to say, all those things I've already had to know.
We're solving the technological solution, then we'll do so much about processes.
Two weeks ago, we made a series Akaton.
where 800 software educators have worked on that brilliant application, they were used in 96 interventions.
Bagfixing, so, putting problems in software, a improvement of documentary, and even to new projects: all this also affects - and we're talking about sustainability and scalability in the site of beautiful to sponsors of Italy to the point of view - where they're exposed - all the documentary - and all the coders, but there are always more, the Italian ones that are helping us from the technological point of view.
For the Italian publication, now there will be a fifth of what would be left, maybe even less.
Audience: Oh!
The future is today, we dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that normally don't limit themselves to do hydraulic, they also enter the boat.
But it serves that the paintings are complete, sorry, I insist, this can be, for example, and it's one of those things that would like to be.
According to the Alsa Association, Alfa is the digital citizenship, has the smartphone, has the digital identity, has the data of electronic identity, it has Nepher.
It's already functional, and all this, the goal is to make the simplest and family the interaction between citizens is the public administration.
With the simple interaction.
We're dreaming a little, because of work we'll really do so much, but it's different from this vision.
A few weeks ago, the storm ...
It's been around 150 years since the world has written an uncertainty.
They waited for many people to talk about what they think can happen, they asked me to talk about simplification of the lives of every day of the citizens.
I've taken the opportunity to write an article that I want to mention to you.
Some fish?
(Audience) Yes.
It's a desire or dream, maybe we do it, we want a country where politicians who try to understand the digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rule and not the exception.
In other words, a country where they read recognize and promote the right to innovate, to embrace it.
A country wants technological skills that are also inside the State and public companies, a country where there are more public and private companies guided by 30 years than for 70 years.
Imagine, in the end, a country where working for public administration is a north, where better brains make people work in public research centers, which are green and their centers of excellence and innovation.
Now it's that if a dream brings a development to the country.
And that the components to do all this, digital, technological processes, are really many and maybe too much, but if it's not a dream about which to punish hardly, things can be done.
First of all, this is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Go to the fact of doing it."
(Audience) Yes!
And here it serves somewhere in this theater, among the other, at this point, for her it's more calm, and I couldn't explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the digital Tinder, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
(Laughter) J: Wow, oh, oh.
And if you want information about us, our site is our social, (Applause)
(Music) (Music)
Did you know the possibility to make a desire?
One only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't go as you'd like.
What would you change?
(Music) What would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your genius, your own collaborators?
You're afraid, you're looking at you, you're going to see that, because here behind you know there's... Then raise your hand those who would change their own body, maybe lose some kilos.
Or maybe win them in muscles?
Ah, here there's already a little more freedom, raise your hand those who would change countless, better understand each other.
(Laughter) I was sure I would have traveled all of them, or maybe you're the ones who would change partner.
(Audience talking) (Audience) Yes!
More times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
Let's not understand if you'll change the parts, and the answer would be because the elementary ones would have a more united family, but the doctors weren't separated.
Thank you very much.
In the media, I would have wanted to be more beautiful, for the pleasure of the youths.
In Liceo, I wanted to feel the most complicated teachers, they seemed to me all the hostiles, and I was reflected in music, here the great voices to make in the living room.
I saw the university, I wanted to work, but I found myself with the difficulty of access to the work market, so all the first part of my life I had to fight and fight to try to understand how to change the things that didn't go well, from what others thought about me, to the great economical hands, from the interpersonal relationships, to my characteristics and my acquired until the birth.
And when did I become a psychologist?
Instead, I looked at my research to other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
But these strategies, if they used in a small dose, could also bring some benefit, but as most cases happen, were the only three maps to play in front of a crisis.
Not only did they solve a good nulla, but they ended up maintaining their problems in life.
Audience: Yes.
The strategy, today, more broadcast, is to lie, we lie it a little bit of everything, there's crisis, there's no work that's traffic, that's cold, that I've done it in a different way, we eat it because there's no justice.
I remember a girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything else than when I started talking to when I stopped going home.
He started lamenting the excitement that had left him, then from the girl with whom he had not helped him, felt like having value, capacity, and now that the mind had completely colonized all his daily life.
But lamenting for all of us is a bit the great attempt, because with a small effort you can get a great result: to review the void of the victim that is listened, comfortable, helped.
But beat well.
You can lament yourself at night or day, alone or with friends, at a high voice or in your mind, you can lament yourself of something that has already happened, or something that maybe a tomorrow could happen.
And you can lament yourself at the roof, or as much more often happens, you can lament yourself to the reason, because we all have many reasons to be able to lament.
But the truth is that for how much you will make you hardly lament something around you will change, elderly, you won't do anything else than giving more attention to what you do.
When things don't go like you would like, it's to lie to you if the strategy that privileges you.
Let's assume that someone is at the study of a B piano to save the skin.
Another very objective strategy, when things are stretched, is to impose our need.
But at the base of this mentality, there's a growing cultural factor, based on which we learned that if something doesn't work well, it's enough to change it, we can manipulate our pleasure, what surrounds us.
But from aesthetic circle.
(Laughter) You feel a bit like this, but why never be in the suffering, take two pillars and we solve it easy?
Your wife breaks you, divorce.
At fresh, we all agree how many risks to the palm.
Your child doesn't listen to you, read it.
It's too big to not register it, send it to the psychologist, we're here for this, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice for this profession, to make the world around you get involved in perfection with your demands.
But the environment inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way.
The relationships of coppy.
(Laughter)
I remember one, a copy, during the collapse of which I didn't do anything else than listening to what, according to one, the other would have to change to solve the resources of their future.
So he said, "Yes."
It's true that you, to agree, but not even to prepare yourself in Chinese, which is also a classicone, and she, "No, if you don't look for me, you don't realize all the things I do for you, and she always begins with the same word stretched.
We have to show them all the equation line of the other, we have to make them see all the problems that should be cured to reproduce our happiness that has kidnapped us.
(Laughter) But the truth is that if this thing we often say it in a good ugly, believing us deeply.
We can hardly change something, elderly, instead of choosing the node at the base of the relationship, we end up irrigidating them to heal them, if the strategy that privileges them.
When things don't go as you want, the one to impose your need and wait for others to modify the consequence.
I think about a couple of times, because I'll have a life ...
It's full of resistance, full of hostility.
Audience: Yes.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, is to make us feel like a tool to take the head and put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, there's the fear of facing the conflict that would emerge, that we should show our needs, and then what do we face them for the common good?
It's the same for me.
But in this way we don't even take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity, and we live in the merce of the needs of others.
(Laughter) I remember a young man and a young man, his son of separated parents, who, at the end of the first childhood, had learned to distress with great diplomacy between the tips of mom and dad, often spinning from the fear of one, would have lost the love of the other.
In this limited situation, I learned important things, for example.
To listen, to accept, to think about the motivations between them, even distant from each other, but on the other hand, they never learned to say "no" to the things they didn't go well, they didn't learn to say "no" to the flaws, and they needed to tell everyone.
It's the strategy that privileges, when things don't go like you're, is to suffer your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you, and instead of telling you all how many, I'll end up uncontainting them.
To wake up, to impose your needs or to suffocate them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say, with the means of cause, because I myself, throughout my life, has abused you, I tell you what happened to me.
One day, the first hospital in which I collaborated sent me to call and said to me, "But Zuckeli, here for her, there's no more place, if you like to continue the collapse with us, you have to accept a transfer."
And he told me a far away place, woke up, detesitated from the most, and above all, I would have to go there to make a job that didn't even enter a big deal with everything I had studied until then.
So I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, trying to make them change the idea, adopting, but sending that other, and even less because I'd never had to accept a commitment that for me was unbearable.
There I understood that, to get different results, I had to do different things.
For the first time, of course, on my legs, at that moment, I realized that the secret, to change the others.
It's changing yourself, if it was changed me.
The others would also be able to follow, modify, change.
And if it was a super brilliant, competent, complete psychologist, the first one wouldn't send me via, if I had also done it, I wouldn't have taken me more time.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
But the answer didn't go to the other's fault, but I had to introduce myself to the profound of my own.
Responsability.
But why things?
They don't change.
So, we are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do is in the direction of choosing ourselves.
To choose yourself as a cause of things that don't go as you'd like.
You choose yourself as a cause of things that are not like you.
This is our bias.
But if I never find the work of the crisis, you're putting the only arms to your disposal.
Now we'll find ourselves alone and in a new language, if reading books, attending courses to acquire new skills, consolidate those who already have, you can work on you to become unique.
Because life is who does it.
Who doesn't do it?
It's enough.
(Laughter) If it's inside the copy, things don't go well, you think it's the other to do the first step.
It's sending you a message of inequality, and you're going away, if you're part of you, and maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question.
So things change, but they don't change, but they don't change for example, but they change because you're you who are changed before going to the research of their lacks that I can do differently to make their best day.
If you're one of those people, if you're one of those people, it's in this way that you create a mental space inside which you can take care of one another instead of making the war.
That they go with everyone, who must always say yes, one of those people I call, ask me in terms, prostitute and relationship.
It's clear that you're not only losing time, but you also lose the sense of meaning, the things you do.
If, instead, you leave yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand which actions you put in the field to preserve them, then the game becomes something inside which you can become a better person.
When I was writing to the university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to understand them that, with my matter, there were practical tools, sometimes even fast to bring great value inside their lives.
But friends, I met with a couple of...
In other words, stereotypes, prejudices, psychologist is the doctor of the mates, the psychologist is the doctor of the debts, but I had to talk to a friend, but I went to the park, but what should I do?
But I had to lament myself, or possible that I didn't tell you how beautiful psychology I had to try to change their mental priority, I had to drop my dream.
No, I had to...
To learn to talk about a language, which was what didn't happen, as the agent closer, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to learn to listen to their needs.
Instead of imposing my own.
In a short time, following this direction, I got results for me inimaginable.
And when I finished my primary school and his transfer proposal, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I don't know what to do.
(Audience) Yes.
I thought about it and, after all, I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as he understood him.
I'm transferred here.
I went home, I killed the computer, and I registered a video that I carried on YouTube, in which I spoke about psychology, here for the cronach, where I learned to punish the anxiety.
In a short time, my YouTube channel has become a reference point in Italy for what psychologists look at in the video, thanks to this thing, every day, thousands of people are approaching the psychology by discussing some of the stereotypes I mentioned before.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm in 79: I divide psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best schools in Italy, and I left my review.
Because, obviously, they saw that my attempt to innovate the profession in a way to communicate it had something sense and in Lombardia I was read to the vice-president of the psychologist.
What do you want to do?
(Audience): Yes.
They don't become reality because, fortunately, or because you've had that.
The theory you have to have is the one that supports, that makes you move forward, who doesn't know how you build and needs to distrugle yourself, because the cube should do it.
It's also so much to discuss your identity, your points of belonging to your certainties, your habits of always.
So, if there's something I've learned from all this inner journey.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but also the most urgent.
It must come to our internal life.
Ten minutes ago I asked you a question: if I had the chance to express a desire, one only to modify a aspect of your life that doesn't come to the rest?
What would you change, have we talked about work, physical perspective, the current contact?
(Laughter) Well, in fact, I'd like to leave you with a gift, at least to prove, it's a small question that was personally very useful, and that is based on the logic that, to get to produce big changes, comes to focus on many small actions.
So, what's the smallest thing?
And easier.
What could you do until now, at the end of the afternoon, to return home after this beautiful day, and that will allow you to take the first step?
To put your life in the direction?
Here you're explaining.
You can think, what is the smallest, the simplest thing you can do to put your life in the direction you live in.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Music)
You see, you have your keys of the fridge, you have to send them.
I've been part of the pull, ugly, but where the bugs, the markets are the prove.
I said, "Oh Rotto la Pelle, I'm on your feet that it's time to change."
You see, when my mother comes, do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to talk for eight minutes.
And I want to take this time by myself, here.
(Audience) Yes.
I had a dream.
To create a integration band, diversity and diversity, percussions are so fast, so immediate, they take the distances and unite the battles.
Are we partners?
We're ready in seven.
You're young, I see them, I see Laura, Paola, Daniele.
I saw them grow.
Our tests were the Mars Day, the day of prove, where this stadium was entered in the school of Andreoli music.
In other words, we picked up the first bidons, we were together, the first waves together.
Then we decided to become a good mark, from there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical brands and travels: the first brands, the first brands in the pieces.
The first satisfaction, the first encounters.
The first satisfaction for the kids, for us, for everything we were doing.
But above all, the first applause.
Unfortunately, a night of the 20th of 2012, the world fell down.
And the real sense of the word.
All the cases were completely unbearable or crowned: a strong earthquake shaped our earths.
And from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of the thousands.
For all the inequalities, we were called this.
As I said, the houses were no longer today.
Many crossed: our proof room, our place where there were all the marks of it was completely district.
And the tools were inside.
What did we do?
I, the Sahara, Marco, Fede, Matteo, we all looked for them.
In the bottles, and the roads.
Are we able?
Luckily, we found all of us.
We've finished all of us inside a tender, in a tender, in the seventh of Middle Ages.
In that tenderness?
There are magnificent things.
We've seen fear sounding stronger.
Because the flag of the fruit sounds stronger than the earthquake: we looked at ourselves in the eyes, with the Earth that treated, to look for a smile, a look.
The Earth was shaking.
Inside that, we built the first tools.
The scary cests.
They became houses, tubes that became...
The tools built and suited with ping pong rocks, to remove them made with big houses, crowned.
We were constantly working, always, there was an amazing energy.
Although we were at a terrible moment.
(Audience) Yes.
The inside was born in our first protocol, we decided to put it on a real sponsor.
However, the group's components were increasing, the friends spent words of 20 that we were, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We are part of the construction of the first protocol: the white man.
Because there were the smallest loops, the biggest loops and the white genius, at that moment we all moved together as a brand of loops.
Then, immediately after, we did the year later, we did the high school, the swarm.
We became all the Marines.
Because we really wanted to navigate and move a moment from our Earth to breathe for a moment, and then we made it crack, this marine monster, immediately after...
50 speakers, this flywheel.
And to conclude, that of this year, the sea of the Moon, the sea of the Moon.
We wanted to close a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There were many things inside this tenderness, and none of us would never have thought that a tender could change life.
But we did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
What are my last ones finishing?
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems to me a favola.
Audience: Yes.
150 concerts spinning in Italy.
The first magician's stage?
The concert in the TV program at home.
It's the lack of radio, right?
And we really did so many.
It's also for me to get rid of it, because this is exactly...
And it's exactly the scenery of life, the factory of the sweat, but also of freshness, that is so much possibility in the future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality?
Now I have to come back from the flows, do you expect me?
Is there still so much?
To build ... (Applause) Thank you all.
(Applause)
(Applause) One, two, three.
(Applause) One, two, three.
(Applause)
Let's do it.
My name is Maria Cristina Ferradini, and in fact I was born as a lawyer, until the moment I asked myself what happened in the last 250 years.
And above all, our Italy, which is often so biased, is a ready country to incorporate these digital innovations and ready to be tested at the same time of innovation.
But this is the digital metaphor, we all take them to us, close to us, an object, I believe almost everyone.
These three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new time, that we have, in some way, historically built arbitrally in the 2000s, which we're living in, and the computer, in fact, is a technological solution that has been extraordinary and has crossed these 250 years.
The Industrial Revolution, the Internet revolution and the Internet soldiers, we probably remember it as a Ferrovia.
What did we study to me?
In school, in fact, it wasn't just a philosophy: we, at the Industrial Revolution, are huge debates, are normally debates, for example, because we need the motorcycle to vapor.
And the vapor motorcycle isn't just a vapor motorcycle, but it's, for example, that has favored, and it has resulted much faster, the United States of carbon, and the network has started to change the modality, but it doesn't make sense.
But we don't only have the motorcycle.
In vapor, we also need the scope motorcycle, because, on the other hand, it's an Italian invention, the motor is broken.
But we need, for example, the automobilistic industry: in fact, before the Christmas industry has developed, when they were able to understand how to get out of the bottle to realize it, and it has become with the scent that has developed the automobilistic industry, and everything that has come to us.
In the Industrial Revolution, we are still followers, for example, for the phone, but not only with the tool that allowed us to avoid continuing to see our letters, and that has speeded the migration of these letters from one part to the other of the world, always more than we knew.
But it's also what has allowed us, and has taught us, to deposit the caves.
On the sea, and yes, because then on the phone we couldn't tempt the sea, and then what did we do, we interrupted everything?
No, we went forward, standing on the sea, and we went around 1858, the first cavity to give a storal dimension was taken from Italy between medicine and the beach, not just two populations that came from agreement, but the first cavity went there.
There's the phone, the phone, we still live it today, we know what it is, we use it, it brings our voice, in 187900 subscribers to Rome, it's only 1877.
Moreover, another invention is electrical energy, the first hundred seconds, where there is the Milan Renaissance, today it's the Renaissance, there, a time in 1873 was built the first continental power plant in Europe.
In that year, on December 30th, the scale was lit.
A part of our story was born from there.
But let's move forward, let's try to make salts that are still in the course, but that has already lived important, and also important emotions from a cultural point of view, but it begins to be born something, to compose something that has never been in the story before: they are the computer, which are calculators.
The recorders who, at the beginning of the '50s, could be in a stadium like this, and they had functions of neurocarcle, simply made the calculation faster.
But they went forward and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors, they started to be the artificial intelligences we know.
At some point, it was decided to open these 50 years of the Internet revolution, something else happened, but in these 50 years, there were research institutions, and above all, there were scopes of all the defenses that have led to develop these laws.
And these challenges, called ARPA, the network, became capable of bringing information to give you an idea, in 1981 they were only 300 the computer connected to the Internet, in 1995 and they were 25 million.
Not many.
But today, it's in the orders of thousands, because we're not talking about the computers we use, but of all these intelligent systems that connect to the network to care about data, to pick up data or to work data.
So, when the mechanical strength, which was introduced by the industrial revolution.
It started to include the Artificial Intelligence of computers.
And mobility ...
And this, according to a phenomenon called the Internet, we had the time we started to live the time we've lived now, which we're living now, the one that is called creative destruction.
It's essentially an industrial process that tells us that what is new progressively destroyed what is old, because we need to make space, and we'll see better how, but this is the story of the great numbers, which I want to make a reflection, try to accompany you.
When, little by little, the Italy hasn't made the Italians yet.
The Minister Ministry, in the middle of the Finances in Inghet, establishes that the 27th of the Middle Ages, is corresponded to the payment and public dependents.
And from 27 to the next months that this happens, at this moment, even if we don't realize it, we are introducing something extraordinary: before the richness of a family, more than a single one, was in their ability to produce good services that were necessary to their own support.
With the security of the payment, the certainty of payment, the fact that the payment was less risky of the stages, less risky of the elevation, it started in some way to move away from the Earth.
And above all, the economic power has transformed the power of good and services in the power of production of one: well, the money.
But there's a second aspect, which is the fridge, and that it's not only the object that frees us from the audience to go and do the spirit every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to preserve, in a massic way, a healthy way, in quantities of food, which has been the fridge.
So, there's the possibility, once again, to focus on something that is not immediately the use of the daily life.
This is the man who begins to live to the speed of the challenges, the speed of the movements, the speed of our movement, the speed of our movement, and then there's a figure that has characterized these years, that is an element that we can define as the qualification of these years, in the time, as we said, has arrived the Internet, but we are very fast.
And finally, when something happened, typically, when you look at the story of understanding the passengers of a century to the other, and sharing data that are not necessarily the zero, 2001 and 2008.
And the American economy started to slow down, and on the other hand, there were Torri Gemelli, and so something in balance has started to change, these equilibrium that seemed solid, we realized that they were very fragile.
But we went forward until there was something that has slowed all the time, and the biggest economic crisis that the Western world, and the oriental world together, had never met, there was no only America to have slowed, almost closed, there was also the orientation.
In other words, there were European states that were to fail, the Greece was already the money of failure, they don't talk about it, but it's still there, but what has changed, the economic paradigm, we couldn't.
Not to wait for the biggest economic crisis that, in fact, was verified in 2008 and was crazy not to think about it, but how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension?
With many less people.
What did these companies do not innovate in their majority, but above all, they are all companies that are Dante after 2011, and it was obvious that it would happen.
inventing something, they didn't innovate building something that before there was, but they started doing what we've always done, buying, selling, learning, in a different way, in a more efficient way.
We are ten percentual points under the media, but, honestly, we are almost close to a fast connection for the 50 percent, according to the informatic systems of digital systems, those advances that allow us to develop.
In fact, a third picture we have to look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it, a third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of the digital factors in the productive processes.
So, comets, or industrialization of products and services, the fifth is digitalization.
The system of public administration: we immediately choose the field of some ambiguity, and we keep the only two that are important: above all, a good news for everyone, all the five elements are increased.
These are all the five elements that are in a growth, in a growth speed, completely inactive to two years ago, so we are slowly looking at the newspapers, and this is a very important competitive tissue.
In fact, it was born a very profound change that is aligned to the European standards: there are two factors that we have to look at with great attention that will be key for our future of countries, and they are the skills and the inclusion of the digital in the productive factors.
And in this, we have to pay a lot of attention to the characteristics of our country, we have two engines.
It's what made the Italy in the '50, there are the small companies.
According to being, the small business, something not useful, not effective, not paragonable to the big multinational companies, in reality.
I'm probably the most effective entrepreneurial tool to interceive the speed of change: they're agile, they're speeds, they're small.
(Laughter) They know how to do something extraordinary that the Made in Italy has an excellence in the production of service, in the production of products that is quite unique in their gender, everyone wants it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, competences inside these realities, because these realities can become those multinationals that can serve.
An internal segment of the market, in an extraordinary way, generating wealth for the whole tissue that is around you: a heritage that, for her nature, for her natural nature, and this is the first assault that we have, the first great motorcycle, we can't digitalize the cloth.
But is it possible that tourists only visit three cities?
Venezuela, circumstances, and then they repeat, I believe that this is the great need to recover, to include this heritage inside a knowledge system that allows us to carry it and enjoy it from making it not only to visit three centers, but to visit all our country, thanks.
(Music)
(Applause) The topic I spoke about in a certain sense is the opposite act of the word "unifies."
And all this?
Our encounter is the opposite of the word "share," because I'll talk not about sharing, but in a certain sense of the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'll talk about inequality, and I'd like to start first.
With a question.
But if someone asked you, "Let's open your hair," in the last 15, 20 years, we say, in the 21st century, inequalities in the world, the inequalities between the citizens of the world are increased or are decreased.
But I believe that most of you will answer, "I'm increased, if you were the journalists, maybe you'll reach the precious goal, they're increased in a exponential way."
And if I asked you, "But in Italy, maybe the answer of many would also be?"
I asked myself these questions in the last few years, and with the only 24th and the foundation of video.
I've been prepared with my colleagues, a report on inequalities from when they are artists, that is, financially, from 1960 to the great majority of the countries in the world.
Audience: Yes.
The result is what you see.
This is the curve of the disguised inequality between the citizens of the world, as you can see, there was indeed an increase of inequalities, especially in the 80s, but from now on.
And in Italy, from the end of the last year, the competitive inequality between the citizens of the world is crossed, precipitated, now we are at the storal mining.
In Italy, as a result, inequality is quite complicated, even here we have an increase throughout the 80s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second Republic.
(Laughter) We have a trend of decreasing inequality.
How can we read these data?
Well, a possible reading is to say, "We've traveled a collective bathroom because we continue to talk about years of argument of inequality, how much data doesn't support our feeling."
And there's really, surely, in this reading, but we could also ask ourselves another question: What if the feeling of an increase of inequalities that many of us?
Let's do it!
(Laughter) It wasn't wrong the feeling, but it was wrong the idea of inequality on which ...
We think about it.
Perhaps?
But we must reflect on the issue of inequality, on what we understand, for inequality.
Maybe the concept of inequality requires some rethink.
We leave this question temporary and we move around a century.
And also, we move to Cambridge in 1928, a year before the great Church of the 29th, Lickens.
It was Cambridge, there was a discourse in front of you.
There's a student audience, a speech then famous, with the title "The Economic possibilities for our grandchildren," the first says, in that occasion, "Keynes forms two professions."
It's a century, productivity.
After an hour working, it will be... (Laughter)
Other times the one of today is 1928.
And this trade, in fact, is made because if you went to take it.
The reconstructions of the history of economy, in most of the advanced society, we have an increase of productivity in the turn of 100 years, which is also of society.
Ten, 12 times, in some case, 15 times, so this teacher was performed, but from this professor Keynes also riched a consequence, an idea, which is humanity.
Soon, in a few years, it would be found with a huge amount of free time that would have taken it to work less than that.
And he also said, "Let's work everyone," and he saw a problem for this, because the question that was asked Keynes, but with all this free time we knew how to use it well, or not.
Well, that's it.
Apparently, this second orphysics hasn't been done.
Because we all see it, that we don't all work, and it doesn't seem exactly what we work three hours a day.
I'll show you that this profile is divided in two parts: neither one that says we'll all work, it's certainly false, but the first part we'll work much less, we'll work three hours a day, we're sure that it's not made by any part, we'll see here in Italy.
That's it.
This curve, this trajectory, represents the time fraction.
That an Italian, medium, is it?
The interesting thing is that this 16% dedicates to work in the course of its life, in its life, naturally, potentially working, that is, for the 15 years, then, when we are able to compare a job, well, if we look at this trajectory, we call it about 16%.
It's two hours and a fourth a day, that is, the barrier of the three hours, in Italy, we've already collapsed it.
Naturally, what is it?
If this happened, there are also reasons.
But there's another reason - there's another most fundamental reason why, of course, and if you want to bank, for example, the old age is normally aligned, then very positive, and other banals, if you want, even at 25 or 30 years old, so also the young girl is aligned.
Our quote of time?
Dedicated to work and crowned.
And it's the crop of the occupation rate, that is, the number of people who work.
This is the historical series of total occupation.
This is built for this occasion and this dramatic series, because it makes you see what?
At the beginning of the century, in all monarchical era, before the Second World War, the occupation rate was even better than 70 percent.
Today we're very low, we're around 50 percent scarce, elderly, from 1968 and 81 years old.
The occupation rate has always been inferior to 50%.
But a rate of inferior occupation to 50%.
What does it mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, that is, pure consumers who don't perceive any network are more workers.
In front of this?
In fact, storal, we can also have a reaction.
But then we see if in the country that the problem of modernity, that is in the United States, things have been in the same way, because if this interpretation is fair, it should have happened in the United States.
Let's go.
Italy.
You were united.
This is the storal series of time.
It's dedicated to work in life, as you can see, in the United States, it's only at the '30s, then it's established, and it's the storage series of the occupation rate, because here we see.
Because even there's an increase: the small one you see below is the crisis of the 29th, we have a general tendency of the occupation rate in the United States at the increase, but in our case we have a situation.
The reduction.
The occupation task.
But then, this is a pathology.
It's not normal.
"Why?"
So, there are more people who consume without producing than the people who produce.
It's not normal that the majority of the population lives in a condition that I'll define.
"Dipendency parassitary," "dependence," "dependence," because I depend on the network of Twisia," this one can also be a family or the State, but it's parassitary because I consume, I have the right to available without working.
I, a friend who does theater's act, when I found these results, we were in the scene and I asked them.
You, how would you represent this situation with an image, a situation of parasitary dependency, and you know what has happened to me?
With the hypothesis, it's that light that lives on the spots of the hypothesis, but it's called buffag, some say buffaga, here it is.
If you want to have an idea of how you behave.
The bubble or the bubble on the prototype, or on the other big mammals, these birds also live on the broken rivers, on the bubbles, well, we have this film, the bubble.
What will interest us for a second, in which you can see?
These...
These fish, these birds.
What mistakes can mean is that if the bubble is happy with the eye, it's not clear that the bubble provides it, which are in sects, the tree, and that all that the bubble is affected by the lights.
Anyway, this is the sociologist, so the question I asked myself as a sociologist.
It's another: how can we define a situation of this kind, how do we define a society in which there's a majority of pure consumers and minority of producers?
There's this kind of productive consumption, the first one I said to myself, "But this is the ignorant society?"
And society, gentlemen, like the feudal society, in which there's a ceiling that has put in the condition of living without working.
But, naturally, it's not enough: you have to add a qualification, this is indeed a condition.
It could be defined by ignorant society, but it's a ignorant society of mass.
(Audience) Yes!
Because consumers are more producers.
In the Spanish society, it's simple: Greek Dubezon, a great anthropologist and psychologist, would have defined it a relationship of Oppio Legame, we see why, after the legacy, because the clear relationship is a relationship of commanding and subtomission, in the society, the signs and the producers are much more complicated.
The relationship?
From bubble with the hypothesis, and from parasitism, and this is a advantage signed in green, but it's also dependence, because it depends on food that's inside it.
Fredce Rossa indicates a disadvantage on the sphere of the hypothesis.
And also from the point of view of producers, we have, again, a red fresh, a green fresh, the autonomous hypothesis doesn't need bubble.
Because we can't, we can't nourish the birds that live on their spices, so the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of legacy, but a situation ...
That's not fine.
Is it a situation in which?
Chorus: Here.
There's a new problem of inequality, and now we get to the question I had asked Keynes: today, perhaps, the real inequality and the inequality of access to work?
The access to work is very asimeteric in our social system, but if inequality is access to work we can use the tools of inequality analysis, that is to calculate a concentration of genius, which is the tool with which we measure inequality, we can apply it to work, there are people who don't work, who have a job, who have two jobs.
And the position of the History, in this scale of inequality of access to work, is dramatic.
The country in which inequality reaches the maximum, but simply because there is the exclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, we would probably have the palm of this creator.
They need us to become an Oxis country, normal, seven million jobs.
As we arrived at this, this is the story of inequality of access to work in Italy, always measured in any kind of genius, you can see something clamorous, that inequality is minimum during the monarchical age, especially in the second public, which we live in.
In more than 1,000 euro per month, we would have 12,000 euros to spend as much as the health and the school put together, more or less in Italy.
Nights.
We have the scholarship to write in the first article of the Constitution, "The Italy is a democratic Republic based on work, we are the only country."
It has this in the first title of the Constitution, and we are the worst country together with the Turkey of the West.
That's why we change things.
And we believe that the seven million jobs that work, or maybe it's better to cancel the article one of the Constitution, because being so things sound like a BEFA.
Thank you (Applause)
