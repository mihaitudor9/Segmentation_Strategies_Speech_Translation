In 2016, a award was my availability in the confrontations of the students and my ability to create less formal data supported by the Ministry of the United Nirland, from the name a little particular, they are born in Hero, we imagine that this is a great university class.
In usually, I go into class.
The first ten minutes, when the students enter and get there, put my computer to explain and put a classic music, I think this is the first step to create data environments less formal and more reassuring, and try to maintain the attention of the students.
Unfortunately, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a method used until the old age.
Storietelling.
At the pedagogical level, the storytelling is a method based on the use of narratives to transmit knowledge to students.
And it's precisely with this method that I'd like to start my lesson explaining to you to describe a topic about the mouth of everyone, already: artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that children tell, I'd like to start my story once.
A second World War.
In 1942.
It's a beautiful king.
Blece and Park.
A north residence of London.
But there was a young and 30 years old.
Alan Turing.
Listen to Laureal King's College of Cambridge, and they get a research doctor in logic, the Princeton University in America.
In that period, the Tedes used a special and enigma machine.
It was like a writing machine.
The operator digitalized details, but since stuck on a paper those letters, I stuck other letters, according to a code imposed mechanically under the sea.
The texts used this mechanism to communicate with them.
Anyone would interceive this paper in front of you without any sense.
It was shouting.
Alan Turing was one of the main paintings in Blece Park, the one you can see behind, able to decipher these tests written by theedes.
For this invention, we think that war is finished with two years of anticipation, saving many human quickly.
In the adventure, continuously, after the war, to do its logical research.
And it's considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
So, with his Turing machine, he formalizes the computer thing, even before the computer was created in practice.
In 1950, an article published on the "Mind" magazine, "Computing Machines and Intelligence."
Where do you propose the test?
The question behind the testing is a very precise one.
They can think machines.
From here, artificial intelligence began.
Probably many of you have seen the film of Emitation Game, the game of limitation, I want to explain to you.
But do we suppose there's a person here?
It's digital to the computer that asks questions and on the other hand of the end, a machine M is an operator.
In an alternative way, the machine M and the speaker or form the answers to the person standing.
It's said that the machine takes over that Test-Touring if the person is not able to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the operator: this is the limit.
But the machine must have special characteristics to overcome the attitude.
It must interpret the natural language.
And the question that comes from the person must represent knowledge to form the answers.
(Laughter) We must think in an automatic way to form these answers.
And it must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence: one of these is cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this process, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to capture thinking in the moment they are in, or we try to modify thinking at a psychological level.
That's why artificial intelligence is said that if we can really have a female representation of human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of the laws of rational thinking, probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man?
All the men are mortal.
The Socrates is dead.
This is a deductive argument.
It's trying to build educational arguments and make them a true conclusion: from here the logic is born, according to the approach of the laws of the thought, from here it's born in a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational agents.
A rational agent, an entity.
(Laughter) It must act.
It must be adapted to the context.
It must be carried out objectives, and know how to bring them to end, and it must act in a rational way.
So the Turing test is linked to intelligent people, reformulating the Turing phrase, a machine to think, we can say, "Can we create a machine?"
An artificial agent, able to think, exhibit intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence, so it's the purpose of creating artificial entities, intelligent, your phone is an entity.
Among the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence as psychological construct, once we have more knowledge.
What about this?
It's close to build artificial, intelligent identity and support of man, it's a chip.
But let's see if machines can think, I'd like to explain to you to describe the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I'd like to use five classes to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We have subtle agents, human parameters, super-humane, for example, optimal agents that manage better than all humans, and we can't do better, for example, agents that solve the cube of Rubik, which has already created a four in the best way, which is able to solve in zero, 73 seconds.
But do we have sovereign people?
That there are better than all people, for example in the game of the rocks, in the scalpy game, a few years ago the Russian scenario, Gasporn, killed by an artificial agent.
We have people who suffer humans, those who manage almost like all people, for example in the Power Texano's game, to answer the question of the ketchu.
We have teeth for the mother.
What do they act?
And finally we have subtle people who manage the worst of all people, for example, in cognitive activities like the crowned words, or the classification of objects.
The recognition of caligraphy, the vocal recognition, the translation of a language to the other.
But if there's something that artificial agents, today, are not able to do, for example, is a disambiguation: we're talking about the fruit like this.
The mum, or are we talking about the mark of the body Apple?
And one thing that agents are not able to do is the reasoning in the ideal world, in uncertainty situations.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence, for which we think we are far from overcoming the test.
Let's see now in the future.
They will be able to think.
A few years ago, in America, a thing was introduced by the name of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest experts in artificial intelligence in the world.
Imagine the time line.
Imagine a line that indicates the human intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a red line that indicates the machine intelligence with an exponential attitude: this moment follows the preview in the wall's leg, so the computer complexity, for example, measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, radiated in two years and in four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil in 2010, we had to be able to make use of this computer competition to simulate the human brain: I didn't have it, in 2020, we would have access to 1,000 dolls to this computer capacity.
In 2025, secondary and crossed, I'll never be able to get rid of our brain in 2029.
And the machines will spend the test, they will overcome the test.
And then, in 2045, and the indication of the moment it will have the technological singularity.
In which machines will follow the intelligence of the machines and will follow an exponential environment that will radically change human intelligence.
Well, in his article.
It's published on the "Mind" magazine, Turing doesn't only proposed its test, but it also proposes new objections against its test, these objections are us, objections, against artificial intelligence.
A few years ago, I was a student at the University of Varese.
Unfortunately, a few years ago, one of the compounds we had to move was to propose a decade against Artificial Intelligence, followed a path of ethical ethics of computer science, given by the Gaithan professor Aur√©lio Lanzerone, unfortunately it left us a few years ago.
OK, what about human stupidity?
It's the desire to describe in simple terms, we suppose to take the intelligence of all people, to put the seed, the symbol of smell to the minister side of the equation, and we'll transfer all this intelligence inside a machine that becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were, to transfer our intelligence inside a machine?
And this becomes more intelligent than us, it's also true that we've left the machine to become more intelligent than us.
So to conclude my story.
And by getting rid of the initial question, the machines can think.
I'd like to leave you with an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
How many of you have taken pictures today?
Thank you.
Well, well, this gives me more or less the measure of not having a journalist who takes care of photography, it's the creative director of a study that takes care of photography, it's still the challenge of a photographer who has had a new language in the way to develop experiences and reflexions, and it's only one of sharing with me.
To find answers, I looked around, and I arrived in New York, in the seventh of IM, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock, in Parigi, in the rooms of Parifot, one of the most prestigious fears in the world, to understand how the photographer changes these ingratulations.
(Laughter) To find answers, I tried to look beyond the surface of the great common places of the contemporary.
The selfie, for example, the selfie to get involved, simply to a delirium narcissive as some psychologists have sustained with the body dismorphism, or can't be seen as a health of the generation of the millennials, as a global warming or Lash Lager.
And at what point we are, the story of the Mobile Photography is short, but the photography, believe, is not the land of the answers, and of this phenomenon I've tried to give a social and historical interpretation to my photographic experiments, it's simply the result of a world's world's world of taste, or, instead, as long as many images that put in communications, individuals, from a angle, a year, at least for a century.
On the other hand, 350 million of these images are carried out every day on Facebook, more than 70 million views, and if the photographer is a new language, then it's the mother's language, a typical vision of the activity that is composed by a constantly based on the expression of our daily experience, which is the way of operating.
But on the other hand, you've tried to think that the possibility of directing to the photography of dialogue with a new model of New Smaking and visualism, which, in the last few years, has operated this photographer and journalism, which has been created, for example, a very interesting photographer from the European history of the Fotography of the Fotography of the Fotography of the Fotography of the Economic Fotographic Fotography, which has been created in the United Nations, in the United Nations, in the United States, which has been created, with a new forms, with a new forms, with a new forms, with a new forms, a new forms, which we have been able to directly, which we have been able to directly designed, in the European Mromotherapy, in the European MEPOVPOLARARARARARARARARARARARARARARARARARARAM,
Brad Mengin, who used it for Sport's photography, exclusive and photographer, a BayStrek, to put in touch the American soldiers of Station in the south of Afghanistan with their families, and created an intimate change of information from their work.
MTI, who used it daily to build his family album, dedicated to the account of a daily and normal Africa, beyond the visual stereotypes, can also be used to put in discussion the Western stereotypes on the crisis and the famine, with a beautiful past and contemporary scholarship, which we don't know how to do all.
To tell, going to the periphery of action, creating images that are never straightened to reality, but that are born from a deep interaction between photographer and content to be diffused in different platforms and reaching different auditions, making network, using innovative connections in the event, and on the quality of cultural metaphor, thanks to everything.
And do you feel it?
I felt it like that.
What we believe is to be silence, in fact, are 50 axes of electric running.
Fifty-thirds that are immediately entered in our lives, waking up from the illusion that silence exists.
"Oh, me, you don't exist, so in this room, those protests, these seeds, and put a frequency of 50RS, then you're imagining, right?
This frequency of 50 Airz, which I simply increased volume, there's always her: eat with your partner, with your partner, except and then you'll tell the bed in our homes, in our lives, but do more or less this sound.
We have a positive aspect.
Well, or better, first of the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist.
But we have a positive aspect.
But we're never alone, that is, this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Well, great, paranoid.
And if we look at it as a drawing, this frequency of 50 Ears is nothing more than a sound wave, a wave with a beautiful rich spectrum, with which we can make music, and then I asked myself, "But why?
Why not make us music?
That's it.
I'm a composer of sound colonies, an artist, I'm now a little special, because I've complicated my life deciding to make music alone and exclusively through rumor.
My parents?
So they divorced when I was little.
And I know, you think this is the classic story in Strappa Lacre, but it was the revelation of my life.
Because in the loneliness of those days, in the weight of the void of that house, I started to make music with all that surrounds us, so ...
Each income complement was no longer.
A classic complement of network, closed, immobile, before voice, but it becomes my musical tool.
With Hampia Joy, among the other of my mom, who every roof didn't find the bikes, among the other man, Macciao, was looking at me from the streaming, and this is a big deal.
Of course, at some point I tried to become a normal person, trying to say, "Dad, why did I start studying Chitarra, piano, then I liked Woody Allen," so I started to stop Clarinetto, the problem I really liked Arenzo Arbur, who wrote a crazy song in Bigo, coming so the first years of study in Genoa.
I also quit the Clarinetto, just like that, to not go ...
I make the illusions of my classmates.
But why did I abandon all this, because I studied and escaped from that notation so rigid, because there is more harmony in a rumor, and I like to paragonate it to the problems of life?
All of us have attacked a rumor, a failure, something that made us think, but I'm sure that that that that that rumor made us grow much more.
So, from a smile, that's why my mission ...
So when I'm a child, it's to transform a failure, a rumor in music, and to harmonize everything around me.
"Thank you."
I'd have been able, I say, "I'll make a beautiful turning point of dollar, Ginopauli," and everything would be concluded, but no, I'm complicated in this way life.
But above all, what is the sound, our inner eye, the protein of the oceans, our team, reach the maximum functionality around the fifth week of gesture.
Because the fact must be ready to what the hospital in life is once born, it must be ready to the Norway, this means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to listen even before seeing, and this is not a case.
It must be ready, so, in a case, if the mother, during pregnancy, listened to Pancroco British, doesn't have to stupid if the child, once born, will be listening, for example, sexistols.
So, future, moms, I prepare you, and it's a richness that I personally pay attention to the musical choice: wait for the trap, more than another, OK?
But what is sound?
The sound is what we are surrounded, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what, in our lives, is completely scared: you don't see, you don't touch, but the colony is time for every day, the lights with our partner, the mother who screams us, because the mother screams us, still, always.
All of this is the column of our days, of course, the visual is much easier, we know it, the visual is when we enter the system's hair, we say.
It's smaller than how I imagined them.
But smaller than what, there's smaller than the man of Milan, smaller than San Pietro, smaller than your house, maybe?
And you understand the same thing as when a person sees me in video, or on stage, and then I meet people and says to me, "I imagined higher, I'd also see, because it's more low, it would be really impossible, so, starting from this budget.
It's what allows us to imagine.
But sound, the study, is what allows us to dream.
Let's imagine our lives, I'd like to genuine your ability to observe, so we're in vacation.
We're in the sea, not in case, and we start to take pictures of feet, in the wise, then the kilometers are not, I've lost the tone, but it's multidensorial, but many of you have, at some point, who are soccer.
But nobody eats the doll.
We photograph it, we look at it, we do so many videos, but we never stop listening.
We never stop listening, but not even a person we know, and I teach you a trick: when you fight with someone?
The best moment to know the person is to stay in silence, that silence that, among the other, doesn't exist: go where, is to listen, to you and listen.
Like in this moment.
So, today I'd like to take you with me, I'd like to bring you with me.
I turn around the world, I was evolving your perception of listening.
For the first time, the listening of myself, and I'd like to start by telling you the dream of my life, the dream of my life that was born, I wanted to run away from the school, a series of failures, problems as another, and now I decided to choose a city on the screen.
And the whole part, really, from the side of the city, was a great musical tool: to wake up this beautiful tool of the world, I had so much fear, I had an idea, but I was the only artistic resident, and started the most beautiful years of my life, for the simple fact that, for the first time, I was listening to me, and I was really far from me, Shanghai, I decided to enter the last city.
And I'd like to take you to this moment to Shanghai, where for 48 hours, I'm not registered the sounds of the city, and I created a sound colony, so at this moment.
I want to sound, Shanghai.
I'm going to touch you, I'm going to inspire you, I'm going to fall, I'm going to fall, I'm going to fall, I'm going to breathe... (Music)
(Video) (English) I'm a doctor, I'm a doctor, I'm a doctor, I'm a doctor, I'm a doctor, I'm a doctor.
Let's see, I'm a little scared, I'm a little bit scared.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Wow!
I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared.
Difference.
Thank you very much.
Okay?
Difference.
(Laughter)
That's it.
Thank you very much.
You were still focused on the visual, and this was a test, it's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test: you were all connected to the visual.
Now, there's a city that is sure, you've photographed in every way, and you've asked yourself more than once, but that smoke that is in the tombs that are done, but the bridge of Brookly is an exceptional exilephon, completely in leg.
And do you want to join?
That's it.
I believe in the Counter that is really touched on the side and something important to say.
Beautiful, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because on the other side of the world.
It's not magical because it's on the other hand, it's magical because under our eyes every day.
And maybe many of you know a pair of places.
In this picture, in this picture, I knew Genova, I knew Genova, because I've captured many times, and I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way, I can tell you that, among my favorite cities, now, I scaven the applause, I'll tell you.
Thank you.
I started to record the first sounds, and the first sounds were given by these children, who in this tube, from iron, from antico, gave me this audio camp.
And I'll make you feel, before the Greek camp, and then, that's worked.
Let's think about it.
Let's go to the span of...
Great.
And I like a poem - I've always done it - that I'm not normal, I've never been - I've attacked this beautiful, and it has restricted me a very low frequency that has become a synthesiser.
MM: Of course, Genova is Mordandis.
(Laughter) It wasn't a battle, this is a serious thing, anyway.
And the writing, which you see constantly in the beach of Ferrari, is not just a writer, for me it's a great musical tool, helped me to support the beat of this column sound, and it's more or less like that.
The last sound, after I really want to sound like Genova, is the one of all the boats of the port.
That we are used to look at the top, but the sound of a tragedy that gave me a particular frequency that became the melody, and so I created this microphone, I immersed it for 48 hours inside the Genova's portion, which is transformed into what the voice of the sound colony is.
That's it.
It's true, now I wanted to make you feel Genova, but I came to this point, "No.
Here's Genova as a sound.
Okay.
Now, do you feel this?
Do you feel this sound?
This is the sound of our passions, in my and your passions, and for how many people will tell you that they're rumorous, they're stuck outside time, you really want to listen to them, and I'll always bring you to listening, thank you!
As it's said Guybek in Italian, the word generally used is restitution, it's not perfect, but the idea of the idea, in generating the idea of restitution linked to monetary restitution to beneficence.
A lot of times, instead, the restitution is linked to reproduce what you did, what you learned.
And going from the part of those who say, "It doesn't work anything," then in Italy it doesn't work anything in this country, we try it, so the next 18 minutes will share some point of this story.
(Laughter) From the end of the '90s, in 1999, precisely, this is my son's ice, he got to Segrate, and in the same year, my monkey organized the collection to pay the asylum material.
It's very heavy, made with many parents, some of them said no, because we have to help, we must think about the common state, but most of them made these extraordinary effort to help the asylum, because they don't remember 600 euros from then.
And it was one of the efforts, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later, we transferred the United States, this is similar, the same similar school for a close school, this is the biggest child.
And there's a completely different reality, that is what was extraordinary for us, we realize that it's a completely extraordinary reality, that is, the issue of the game of restitution is very normal.
So the extraordinary effort of a magnitude of Italian parents, is ordinary for all this: I said this, the concept of restitution, I've had fortune, I've had fortune, I've helped the university, I've helped the museum, theater, there's all the communities, financially, of volunteer, it's not based on this: it's a phenomenon and a positive circle.
The site that says, "Desistemy is from now on."
Trump is trying us very actively to ask ourselves if the system is given to a moment.
Obama has been a famous bank, and there was an incredible technological debate.
These things don't happen only in Italy, they build a site that doesn't work for a few days, but then someone has stopped criticizing and it's enough to criticize that it's easy and normal to help that it's difficult to study, so it's not a common thing.
KA: This is Time Magazine's coverage, which refers to the experts of technologies sent by Google and other companies, they've been offered, and I agree with the Bianca house, there's no RIA that is detected, it's put in a few weeks, has a decim of costs.
After that, many of you would have criticized, but Google, surely, is their interests, it's what I want to explain from what was spinning, I'm spinning from people who haven't learned a lot about their lives, they have decided to reproduce the experiences that had filled their lives.
But in this case?
But they look at the ability to manage big technological systems, complex, unbearable, repeated processes.
To make them again possible and unbearable, and to create a replicable system, which is the East Digital of this sport, then a replicable system, what we hope to do with us.
But I want to talk about the word model, because one also implies the models, which are the models that are part of this bag, that we need to use, we want to reproduce.
For me, obviously, I played not only what we said until now, but also the Italy factor, I wanted to do it: almost 20 years ago, the idea of helping there was also because I'm Italian, two hours of risk.
To do or not do, there's no attempt, maybe the Italian river is to do or not do, there's only to criticize.
A few years later, we're five to meet Mateorence without Francesco, and we've come to the Silicon Valley to make the necessity of the general transformation, in which things get us disappointed a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of the processes and the digital transformation of the public administration requires me, because it doesn't come to help us for a couple of years, I think it's reflected in my wife's pavement, Monica, and I talk to my genius, to get the brief, I decided to apply and I didn't get it, or I don't get it, or I think, or I don't even try it.
The choice was made, and so it goes to the Rome for two years, in the middle of Amazon.
But those who have to do it, Mallia, Amazon, Probono, Maiday, something will give you underwater, these are only many phrases, I have to say that we've also received so much support, so at this moment we're focusing on this part, but in a positive part there was.
But I was mentally preparing for skepticism and bureaucracy, people ask me, "But do you expect these little bubbles, and yes, I didn't expect it, of course?"
But scientificism isn't often cynicism that characterizes a certain mentality, it will never make it, of course, because you have rights, I've heard a lot of this kind, and this country will never make it the sense of common good.
And to do things because you think of helping, to improve a situation not only because it's not interested.
And here's it, for the days of you, this is a commissioner, for the oldest ones you recognize it, as a extraordinary commission, and simply because it's the rule that allowed me to be able to take people from the public administration.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is, as the systems from inside don't become, we want a small team to read 25 people, a large world, but it's also too small, technological experts, around 80 percent, and expert in making legal, governments, communication.
Here you can see the post I had done when, by myself, I started this adventure, I said, because we don't write what I think will happen, in this way we want to attract talents, the talents you live in Italy, or that you want to come back.
It's also temporary, it has a very well-being compensation of what you see, as I'm convinced, so I've put myself in the idea, but how do I convince someone to do the same thing I'm doing now, in the '47s, all the United States, the United States, in this massive sport, the investment of infrastructure?
We created the vision that the operative system of the country is a series of fundamental components that can build simpler services for citizens, the public administration and companies, a very beautiful vision of implementation: Lacrime and blood.
I've continued in my place: soccer field in Salita, but that American soccer, I'm wrong.
And I continued, we'll also have many rules complicated, sometimes incomprehensible, it's a easy prediction: we must learn to manage with intelligence and bureaucracy, many of them will not understand how public administration works, they've already tried us in many, they've failed in Italy, it doesn't work like that.
And we'll continue, we'll get many criticisms: some comments will be useful, others will be precise and prejudices, the criticisms of the first type riding of people who want to really offer their contribution and have found them a lot.
The second kind of color they want to defend the state of school is that they always see the bubble in the middle of the void, or that they simply have been drawn to the power, and this is our problem: to bring things that don't work.
Remember this image: the first, men and women on the cover of Time Magazin.
That's it, here, so, despite I tried to scare the most possible people to do with the eye, I received about 3,000 questions, and we immediately started to operate, what do we do?
(Laughter) In fact, we take care of Draulica.
These are the tubes of the administration public, some of them to do a lot about connecting, because the big problem is that the systems, the applications, anything that should be interconnected, and asylum, don't connect.
And I'm not only talking about Washington Machim, I'm also talking about people who don't want to explore their own data, their own applications, so it's introduced to explain it, and in years, to implement it, to connectivity, to interruptability.
And sponsoring the code of public administration, the emerging heart of the software, you have to make them improving the interference of the tents, making them easier, all these things are made in parallel, but without the tubes, you can't do the chest.
After a few months, in the midst of 2017 we wrote the piano "Trienna" to the Administration Transformation, we did together with the AGI of other people who helped us, what does something exist?
Two are written in a clear, technological way, but also in the process.
For the first time, it was assessed and sponsorized by the government, the triennal piano requires a game of square to simplify the public administration, the city of the citizen, particularity of the piano, once a year, because the pieces can't be put in Italy, in the public administration.
It's regulating the rules, the technical rules, and you read exactly three pages of view and connections to other norms in other rules, in a certain point, the technical rules are quite incomprehensible: uncomfortable, then we can't fly these things, but we can talk to the administrators, the technological ones, the software, the software, the software, and the software, then they can improve it.
But we dedicate ourselves to this particular moment, and this is always a part of the piano, to the digital platforms, one: digital payments, electronic cards, electronic platforms, which is a habitant platform, digital identity.
But the greatest project that we've followed is called national and resilient population.
In the beginning of the thing I've been managing, manually, and then I have to tell you all the citizens that, at this moment, are at 8,000 different levels, which are the 8,000 Italian, in the only Database, where data is talked about a common to the other, I have to say, all those things I've already had to know.
(Laughter) We're resolving a technological solution, then we'll do so much about processes.
Two weeks ago, we made a series Akaton.
It was made in 25 Italian cities, without Francisco, even though it wasn't Italian, but there are many Italians who are helping us from the technological point of view, like from the History.
All of this reflects - we're talking about sustainability and scalability in the sight of old and sponsors of Italy, like T, where they're exposed, all the documentary, in all the codes, but they're always more, apps.
In the Italian publication, now there will be a fifth of what would be left, maybe even less.
The future is today, we dream a little, we're also working on other projects that normally don't limit themselves to do hydraulic, they also enter the boat.
But it's true that the paintings are complicated, sorry, I insist, this could be, for example, one of those things that would add to the high-pitched version to the digital identity, to the digital identity, to the data of the electronic identity, to the electronic identity, to the work, to really do so much, but to have this vision.
A few weeks ago, the storm.
(Laughter) I've spent 150 years writing an uncertainty the world that expects us to ask many people to talk about what they think can happen, I've been asked to talk about simplification of the lives of all the days of the citizens, I've taken the opportunity to write an article that I want to mention some fish.
It's a desire or dream, maybe we do it, we want a country where politicians who try to understand the digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rule and not the choice.
A country where they read recognize and promote the right to innovate, to embrace it.
Well, a country with technological skills that are also inside the State and public companies, a country where there are more public and private companies guided by 30 years than for 70 years.
Imagine, in the end, a country where working for public administration is a northern, where the best brains to work in public research centers, which are green and precisely the centers of excellence and innovation that take development to the country.
That's why it's a dream.
But if it's not a dream about which digital, technological processes are really many, and maybe too many, and that the components to do all this politically can be done.
First of all, this is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Don't do it.
And here it serves somewhere in this theater, on this point, but it's more calm, and I couldn't explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the digital Tinder, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
And if you want information about us, our site is our social networks.
And did you know the possibility to make a desire?
One only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't go as you'd like.
So, what would change?
And what would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your genius, your employees?
You're afraid, you're looking at you, it's for that, because here behind you know there's.
So raise your hand those who would change their own body, maybe lose some kilos, or maybe win them, muscles.
Ah, well, here there's already a little more freedom: raise your hand those who will change countless, better understand each other.
Of this, I was sure I would have taken everything, or maybe you're the ones who would change part of it.
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter) The more times, throughout my life, I asked myself this question: Let's understand if I won't change the part, and the answer was worth it because I would have a more united family, but my parents didn't separate.
In the media, I would have wanted to be better, for the pleasure of the youths.
In Liceo, I wanted to feel the most complicated teachers, they seemed to me all the hostiles, and I was reflected in music, here the great void to make in the living room.
I went to the university, I wanted to work, but I found myself with the difficulty of access to the work market, so all the first part of my life I spent fighting and trying to understand how to change the things that didn't go well, from what others thought of me, to the great economical hands, from interpersonal relationships, to characteristics and my acquired me, until I was born, when I became a psychologist.
However, I looked at my research to other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies: these strategies, if they used in small doses, could also take some benefits, but as most of the cases, were the only ones to keep their problem in life.
Today, the most broad strategy is to grow.
And we lament it a little bit of everything.
In other words, there's crisis, there's no work that's traffic, that's cold, that I'd have done in a different way, we'll miss it because there's no justice, we know many people who fit in the bottle of the window, and it's paralyzed to the spot.
I remember a girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything else than to get rid of when she started to talk to her, then from the girl with whom she had translated her.
So the fact that I didn't have work, the last work of the government that hadn't helped it, felt like a real value, a capacity, and now that the mind had completely colonized all its daily life, because with a small effort I could get a great result, but lamented for all of us, helped.
But, well, you can lament yourself at the roof, or in your mind, you can lament yourself at night or with friends, at the top, or in your mind, because we will all have many reasons to be able to lament.
But the truth is that for how much you will make you hardly remember something around you, it will change, elderly, you won't do anything else than giving more attention to what you say.
If the strategy that for the villages, when things don't go as you want, is to slow down, presents that someone is at the study of a B piano to save the leg, in the mouth to the magnifying glass.
Another very objective strategy, when things are stretching us, based on which we learned that if something doesn't work well, it's enough to change it, we can manipulate our pleasure, what surrounds us, we don't like the ship, but also the aesthetic rule.
So you feel a little bit like this, but why never be in the suffering, take two pillars and resolve it?
Your red wife, divorce.
I have fresh, we all agree how many risks on the palm: your child doesn't listen to you, less.
(Laughter) It's too big not to register it, to send it to the psychologist, we're here for this, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice is for this profession, to make the world around you get involved in perfection with your demands.
The context inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way are the relationships of the body.
I remember one, a copy, during the collapse of which I didn't do anything else than listening to what, according to one, the other would have to change to solve the resources of their future.
Hey.
Well, of course, for you to agree, but not even to prepare yourself in Chinese, which is also a classicone, and she, "No, if you don't look for me anymore, you have to make them see all the problems that should be cured to reproduce our happiness that has been kidnapped us."
But the truth is that if this thing we often say it in a good ugly, believing deeply, when things don't go as you want, that of imporing your need and expecting others to change them, because it will have a full of resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, is to make us feel like a tool to take the head and put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, there's the fear of facing the conflict that would emerge, that we should show our needs, and then what do we deal with them for the common good?
But in this way we don't even take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity, and we live in the merce of the needs of others.
I remember a young boy, a young boy, a son of separated parents, who, at the end of the first childhood, had learned to distress with great diplomacy between the children of mom and dad.
I hope I hope that when you were openly drawn in the face of one, you would have lost the love of the other, in this limited situation.
I learned important things, for example, in words.
To listen to accept, to think about the motivations between them, even distant from each other, but on the other hand, they never learned to say no to the things they didn't go well, they didn't learn to tell their desires and ambitions, they were always supposed to tell you how much.
If the strategy of privileges, when things don't go like you're, it's to suffer your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you, and instead of telling all of you, I'll end up failing.
To wake up, to impose your needs or to suffocate them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say, with the means of cause, because I myself, throughout my life, have abused.
I'll tell you what happened to me.
One day, the first hospital in which I collaborated sent me to call and said to me, "But Zuccelli, here for her, there's no more place.
If you like to continue the collapse with us, you have to accept a transfer, and I'll tell myself a far away place, woke up, and you'll be able to go there to make a job that didn't even enter a big deal with everything I had studied until then.
So I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, trying to make them change the idea, adopting, but sending that other, and even less because I'd never had to accept a commitment that for me was unbearable.
And there I realized that, to get different results, I had to do different things.
For the first time, of course, on my legs, at that moment, I realized that the secret to change the others.
And changing yourself.
And if it was changed me?
But also the others would be able to follow, change.
If I had become a super brilliant, competent psychologist, complete, unique, the first I wouldn't have sent me, if I hadn't done it, the thing wouldn't have taken me more than that, old, maybe I'd have gone through me before I wasn't that person.
But the answer didn't go to the other's fault, but I had to introduce myself in the profound of my responsibilities.
Why things?
But they don't change.
We are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do is in the direction of choosing ourselves.
To choose yourself as a cause of things that don't go as you want.
You choose yourself as a cause of things that don't go as you want.
This is our bubble.
But if I never find the work of the crisis, you're putting the only arms to your disposal.
Now we'll find ourselves alone and in a new language, if reading books, attending courses to acquire new skills, consolidate those who already have, you can work on you to become unique, because life is about those who don't do it.
And if inside the copy, things don't go well, you think it's the other to do the first step.
It's in this way that he believes a mental space before going to the research of his mankind, now he's looking for his needs, then things change, if instead of doing it, and he's going away, and maybe his contribution, every day, this simple question, but don't change because you know what you're changing.
I don't know, one of those people.
That they go with everyone, who must always say, "Yes, one of those people I call, ask me in terms, in a relationship prostitute."
It's clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose the sense of meaning, the things you do, if you leave yourself, to understand your needs, try to understand which actions put in the field to preserve them, then the game becomes something inside their lives, then you can become the pattern of the table.
There were stereotypes, prejudices, psychologist is the doctor of the mates, the psychologist is the doctor of the debts, but I had to talk to a friend, but I went to the park, but what should I do?
I had to lie to myself, or possible that I didn't tell you how much good psychology would have to change my dream, no, I had to learn to speak a language, which was the one that didn't happen, as close to the object, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to listen to their needs, instead of mine.
In a short time, following this direction?
I've got results for me, unimaginable.
And when I finished the collapse with my primary and its transfer, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I didn't know what to do.
I thought about it, and in the end I decided, I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as he understood him, I was transferred here.
I went home, I killed the computer, and I registered a video I carried on YouTube, in which I spoke about psychology, here for the chronologist, I say, to take a few launch, because maybe you think it's.
In a short time, my YouTube channel was recognized that my attempt to innovate the profession and the way to communicate it had something like this: I'm in 79: I divide psychology in Italy, I asked myself to become a director, and today, in two months, in the best schools, in Italy, and in Italy, and what has collected me more than everything, every day, in Italy, in Italy, for what is the psychology.
But they don't become reality because, fortunately, or because you've had that.
The theory that you have to have is the one that keeps moving forward, who doesn't know how you build and needs to distrugle yourself, because the culprit should do it.
It's also so much to discuss your identity, your points of belonging to your certainties, your habits of always, here.
If there's something I learned from all this inner journey.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but also the most urgent.
It must come to our internal, ten motivations asked you a question.
If we had the chance to express a desire, one only to modify a aspect of your life, that doesn't happen, what would you change, we've talked about the work, the physical perspective, the short story?
Well, in fact, I'd like to leave you with a gift, at least to prove, it's a small question that was personally very useful, and that is based on the logic that, to get to produce big changes, it's about many small actions.
But what's the smallest and simplest thing?
What could you do until now, at the end of the afternoon, with the return home after this beautiful newspaper, and that will allow you to take the first step?
Thank you very much.
To put your life in the direction that you auspiciate.
And you can think, what is the smallest, the simplest thing you can do to put your life in the direction you live in.
You see, you have the keys of the burden, even if you eat, or you're part of the pull, right, but where do the bathrooms... or we'll close the open road?
Or on your feet, what's time to change?
Oh, you see, when my mother comes, do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to talk for eight minutes.
And that's it.
Well, I want to take this time by myself, here.
I had a dream.
To create a integration band, diversity and diversity, percussions are so fast, so immediate, they take the distances and unite the battles.
But we left.
We're lost in seven.
If you were young, I see them, I see the Laura, the Paola, Daniele, I saw them grow, our proveers were the mark of, the mark was the day of prove, where this stadium was entered in the school of Andreoli music.
We took the first bidons, we were together, the first waves together.
Then we decided to become a good mark, from there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical brands and travels: the first businesses, the first brands in good pieces, the first satisfaction, the first encounters.
KA: The first satisfaction for the kids, for us, for everything we were doing.
But above all, the first applause.
Unfortunately, a night of the 20th of 2012, the world was crossed, in the true sense of the word.
All the cases were completely unbearable or crossed: a strong earthquake scenario, taken our land, and from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of the thousands.
For all the inequalities, we were called this.
As I said, the houses were no longer agible, very crossed, our proof room, our place where ...
Where there were all the markets, it was completely district.
And the tools were inside.
But what did we do?
I, the Sahara, Marco, Fede, Matteo, we all looked for them.
GV: You have them in doppoli, and the steps.
And we were able.
Luckily, we found them all.
We're all finished inside a tender, in a tenderness in the thirst of the end of the millennials, inside that tenderness, there are magnificent things.
We've seen fear sounding stronger, we looked at ourselves in the eyes, with the Earth that treated, to look for a smile, a look.
And the Earth was shaking.
Inside there, we built the first tools: the scars of scars.
They became houses in the bank.
There are tubes that have become.
The tools built and suited with ping pong racks, to remove them made with big houses, crowned.
We were constantly working, always, there was an amazing energy.
Even if we were at a terrible moment.
The inside was born in our first protocol, so the group's components were increasing, the friends spent the 20 that we were, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
And we started with the construction of the first protocol: the white, because there were the smallest loops, the smallest loops and the white genius, at that moment, we all moved together as a brand of lights.
Then, immediately after, did we do it?
So, the year later, we did the other sponsorship, the curve.
We became all marine.
Because we really wanted to navigate and also move for a moment of our Earth, to breathe for a moment.
Then the year later we made a crack, this marine monster, immediately after.
50 speakers, this flying ship.
And to finish, that of this year, the sea of the Moon, the sea of the Moon.
We wanted to close a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There were many things inside this tenderness, and none of us would never have thought that a tender could change life.
But we did it.
But I want to tell you something.
The minutes are finishing me.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems to me a favola.
It's 150 concerts in turn for the adventure.
The first magician's stage?
The concert, in the TV program at home, is the lack of material, and we really did so many.
And also to me, being forbidden, because this is exactly me.
And it's exactly the scenery of life, the factory of the sweat, but also of freshness, that is so much possibility to the future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality?
Now I have to go back from the flows, they wait for us to build, thanks to all.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Ferradini, and in fact, I was born as a lawyer, until the moment I asked myself what happened in the last 250 years, I'm 250 years old, and that we live today.
It's about social innovation, and my question is: What is this social innovation, and above all, our Italy, which is often so biased, is a country ready to incorporate this innovation innovation?
This is the digital metaphor, we all take it to us, to us, an object, I believe, almost everyone.
In fact, it wasn't only a Ferrovia, the phone is a technological solution that has been transported in these 250 years, and the computer has evolved in the hospitals, the Industrial Revolution, the Internet Revolution, and the phone, and then the vapor is not only a vapor motorcycle, which has been able to change the modality of these 250 years.
And we don't only have the motorcycle.
In vapor, we must, for example, the automobilistic industry: in fact, before the Christmas industry, because the motorcycle, because, on the other hand, it's a Toscana invention, in Italian investment, when they couldn't understand how to make that scent, to understand it, and it became with the scentil that has developed the automobilistic industry, and everything that has arrived, but not only.
But in the Industrial Revolution, we are still in debates, for example, for the phone, the phone is not only with the tool that allowed us to avoid continuing to see our letters from one part to the other, always more broad than we knew.
But it's also what has allowed us, and has taught us to deposit the caves.
And under the sea.
And yes, because then it was the phone, we couldn't try it in the sea, and then what we were doing, we interrupted everything: no, we went forward, standing on the roads on the sea, the first cavity was there.
And we are around 1858.
But there's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know what it is, we use it, brings our voice, in 187900 subscribers to Rome, is only 1877.
Another intention is electrical energy, which is the Milan Rinascente, today is the teenager, there, a time in 1873 was built by the first electric central, the first electrical central power.
In that year, on December 30th, the scarce was lit.
A part of our history was born exactly there.
Let's move forward, let's try to do some things, there were more significant development institutions, always more structural, but it begins to be born something, to compose something that has never been in the first history, but at some point, it's decided to open these laws.
And these challenges, called ARPA, ARPANET, are extremely captured, able to bring information, to give you an idea, in 1981 they were only 395 and they were 25 million, a horizontal system, not hierarchical, not many.
Today, it's in the orders of thousands, because we're not talking about the computers we use, but of all these intelligent systems that connect to the network to care about data, to pick up data or to work for data.
When the mechanical strength that was made of replaced, that was introduced by industrial revolution, started to include the Artificial Intelligence of the Computers.
And mobility.
That I'm essentially an industrial process that tells us that what is a new progressively destroyed what is old because we've lived now, and we'll see better how, but this is the story of the great inventions of the Internet, we've had the time that we started to live in the time that we've lived now, that we're living now, the one that has been trying to accompany you.
It was 1863, when, little by little, the Italy hasn't made the Italians yet.
And the Minister Mingetti, put in English finances, establishes that the 27th of the Middle Ages, is corresponded to the payment and public dependents.
And from 27 months later, that this happens, at this moment, even if we don't realize it, we are introducing something extraordinary: before the wealth of a family, more than a singer, was in their ability to produce good services that were necessary to their own support.
With the security of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky of the stages, less risky of the event, started in some way from far away from the Earth, and above all, transformed the economic power of good and services in the production of one: the denial.
But there's a second aspect, which is the fridge, and that it's not only the object that frees us from the emergency of going to do the spirit every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to preserve, in a massic way, a healthy way, in quantities of food.
So it gives us the possibility, once again, to focus on something that is not immediately the use of everyday life.
This is the man who begins to live to the speed of the challenges, the speed of the movements, the speed of our movement, the speed of our movement, and then there's a figure that has characterized these years, we, today, do the very fast things, and we move fast, and the speed of our thinking that is not said, but we are very fast.
But until then something happened: typically, when you look at the story, to understand the passengers from one second to the other, and sharing data that are not necessarily zero.
In 1900, 1900 - 1900 - 2001, when we can say that it's finished the 20th century, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two data that are significantly segregated from a time to another, 2001 because in the beginning.
So the American economy started to slow down, and on the other hand, there were Torri Gemelli, and so something in balance has started to change, these balances that seemed solid, we realized that they were very fragile.
But we went forward until there was something that has slowed all the time, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world, and the oriental world together, had never met, there was no only America to have slowed, almost closed, there was also the orientation.
But there were Europeans who were to fail, the Greece was already the leaves of failure, they don't talk to us, but still there.
It's changed something, but what has changed is changed, the economic paradigm we couldn't.
But not to wait for the biggest economic crisis that, in fact, was verified in 2008 and was crazy not to think about it, but how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension?
With many less people.
What did these companies do, if they were not innovated, inventing something, they didn't innovate after 2011, but above all, they're all companies that are dancing after 2011, but they started to do what we've always done, to buy, to travel, learn.
And in a different way, in a more efficient way.
In Italy, the Italy is often denied, and so little, still something, according to human health skills, competences of curving it, of a different being, between advanced and basic skills, with what allow us to develop.
On the other hand, connectivity, we've said it in ten points out, but, obviously, it's enough to look at the newspapers and see that we're growing fast, there are new in exchange between new competitions, a very important fabric, so the commerce, a third fact that we need to look at the use of all, all, all the five elements that are increasing in a growth, in an increasing speed, in a speed of growth, at the end of two years ago, so we're completely in two years ago.
In fact, it was born a very profound change that is not effective for the characteristics of our country: we have two engines that we have to look at with great attention that will be key for our future of countries, the first motorcycle, not paragonable, in reality.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, competences inside these realities, because these realities can become those multinationalities that can help them.
A whole segment of the market, in an extraordinary way, generating wealth for the whole tissue that is around you: a heritage that, for her natural nature, but possible that tourists visit only precious, Venezuela, Rome, and then repeat, but the richness of these three cities don't make the richness of our country.
And we're learning, maybe we've tried to start, but we're fast to recover, to include this heritage inside a knowledge system that allows us to carry it and enjoy it, not only to visit three centers, but to visit all our country, I believe that this is the great need that we can do in our Italy.
It was my discovery.
I'll talk about it in a certain sense, because I'll talk not about sharing, but in a certain sense of the opposite of sharing, which is inequality, I'll talk about inequality, and I'd like to start first.
But if someone asked you, and if I asked you, but in Italy, with a question, if you were the journalists, maybe, reach the precious goal in Brussia Pelo, maybe the answer of you would also be decreased.
I asked myself these questions in the last few years, and with the only 24th of the Foundation of video, I prepared with my colleagues a report on the inequalities from when they are art, which is financially from the country of the world.
And the result is what you see.
This is the curve of the development of inequality, directly between the citizens of the world, as you can see, there was indeed an increase of inequalities, especially in the 80s, but from now on.
In Italy, from the end of the last century, at the end of the '90s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second Republic.
AC: We have a trend of inequality of growth.
And how can we read these data?
Well, a possible reading is to say, "We've traveled a collective bathroom because we continue to talk about years of argument of inequality, how much data is not supposedly in this reading."
But we could also ask ourselves another question: What if the feeling of an increase of inequalities that many of us have the same?
We're not wrong with the feeling, but maybe we've failed the idea of inequality in which we think.
(Audience raises hands)
We must reflect on the concept of inequality, on what we understand, for inequality, maybe the concept of inequality requires a century.
And also of course, we move to Cambridge in 1928, a year before the great Church of 29: Lickens.
And he saw a problem for this, because the question that was asked Keynes is, in fact, a week of 15 hours of work, it pronounces a speech in a few cases, 15 times, so, in front of a large amount of life, we understood a lot of less, that is, in fact, a lot of economical productivity, for our 928.
(Laughter) Well.
Apparently, this second teacher didn't realize it, because we all see it, that we don't all work, and it doesn't seem exactly what we work three hours a day.
I'll show you that this profession is divided in two parts: in one that says we'll all work, it's certainly false, but the first part we'll work much less, we'll work three hours a day, we're sure it's not made from anywhere, we'll see that happens in Italy.
That's it.
Well, if we look at this trajectory, it represents the fraction of time that an Italian dedicates to work throughout his life, its life naturally potentially working, that is, for the 15 years, then, when we dedicate to work in the course of our lives.
And to work, and now we look for 16% and the interesting thing is that this 16%.
It's two hours and a fourth a day, that is, the barrier of the three hours we have already collapsed in Italy.
Well, naturally.
If this happened, there are very positive reasons, and other banals, if you want, obvious and if you want to bank, in our children often study long, for example, the old age is enormously aligned, because we die much later, the life expectancy is also a more fundamental reason why.
So, our quote of time.
I dedicated to work and believed.
And it's the test of occupation, that is, the number of people who work.
This is the historical series of total occupation.
It's built for this occasion and this dramatic series, because it makes you see what?
And at the beginning of the century, in all the monarchical era, before the Second World War, the occupation rate was even better than 70%.
AC: Today.
Basically, we're around 50 percent scarce, we're very low, we're around 50 percent, which means that there are more people who don't work than the people who work, that is, the purchasing consumers who don't perceive any network are more workers.
But, in front of this?
In fact, storal, we can also have a reaction.
But then we see if, in the country that the problem of modernity, that is in the United States, things have been in the same way, because if this interpretation is fair, it should have happened even in the United States.
And these were the United States: this is the storal series of time.
It's dedicated to work in life, as you can see, in the United States it's only, until the '30s, then it's established, and it's a lighter tendency to the increase while we grow, but even more impressive, and the storage series of the occupation rate, because here we see.
There's an increase, that small one you see below is the crisis of the 29th, but after the crisis of the 29th, we have a general tendency of the occupation rate in the United States at the increase, and in our case we have a situation of reduction of the occupation rate.
But then, this is a pathology.
But it's not normal, what?
There are more people who consume without producing than the people who produce.
But it's not normal that the majority of the population lives in a condition that I'll define.
A parasitary dependency, dependency, because I depend on the network of Twisia, this one can also be a family, the State.
(Laughter) But it seems like this, because I consume, I have the right to available without working.
But I, a friend who does theater's act, when I found these results, we were in the scene and asked them.
You, how would you represent this situation with an image, a situation of parasitary dependence, and you know what has answered to me?
With the hypothesis, it's that light that lives on the spots of the hypothesis, but it's called buffag, some say buffaga, here it is.
If you want to have an idea of how the bubble or the bubble on the prototype, or on the other big mammals, these fish also live on the bridges, on the bubbles, well, we have this film that will treat us for a few seconds, in which you can see.
[A.DE.]
What about these fish?
How do they live?
Anyway, this is the resources that the bubble is happy, that the bubble is happy, that the bubble is happy, but I'm not an ethology, I do the sociologist, so the question that I asked myself as a sociologist.
There's this kind of productive consumer, the first one, there's a society that has put in the condition of living without working, but naturally it's not enough to achieve a qualification: this is indeed a condition.
That it could be defined by ignorant society, but it's a mass society.
Audience: Yes!
Because the consumers are more producers, in the simplic society, classic society, we have the sign and the series of the jungle that produce for him, in the society, and here the clear relationship is a relationship of commanding and subtomission, in the society, signals have become many.
The relationship between signs and producers is much more complicated: Greek Dubezon, a great psychologist anthropologist, would have defined a relationship of legacy, we see why.
KA: The relationship?
From bubble with the hypothesis and parasitism, and this is a advantage signed in green, but it's also dependence, because it depends on food that is on the sphere of the body, the freezing indicates a disadvantage.
Because we can't, we don't need bubble, but it's also from the point of view of producers, we have, again, a red fresh and green light, the hypothesis doesn't need bubble, but it's in some way, in a very complex report, and this is a situation of doppio-legama, but a situation.
That's not fine.
Is it a situation in which?
There's a new problem of inequality, and now we get to the question I had done talking about Keynes: today, maybe the real inequality and the inequality of access to work, the access to work is very asimeterical in our social system, which is the tool with which.
And if we measure inequality, we can apply it to work: there are people who don't work, who have a job, who have two workers.
And the position of the History, in this scale of inequality of access to work, is dramatic, the position of the History is to be penitimate in the graduation, if we were a Islamic country, we would probably have the palm of this creator.
The best situation is the one of Norway, with the United States, put in the middle.
Or do they miss us?
To become a normal country, seven million jobs positions.
As we arrived at this, this is the story of inequality of access to work in Italy, always measured in any kind of genius, you can see something clamorous, that inequality is the minimum, during the monarchical age, especially in the second public that is in which we live in.
And they would perceive 1,000 euro a month, in more, we would have 12,000 euros of round, in more.
In the year, and our state would have 150 billion euros to spend as much as they cost the health and the school put together, more or less in Italy.
But here I conclude.
But there's one.
Audience: No.
We are the only country that has this in the first title of the Constitution, and we are the worst country together with the accident's Turkey.
So, or we change things, why, because being so the things sound like a bubble that works.
