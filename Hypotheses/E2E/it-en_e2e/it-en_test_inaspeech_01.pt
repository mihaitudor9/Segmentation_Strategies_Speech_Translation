(Applause) Have you found?
Power and fragility.
And some of you will wonder what they have to do, these two words apparently so far: you have to know that, until a few years ago, my two larger children, Mars and Francesca, to sleep, they chose two words.
So the story begins with the only child: Riciolino, I'll tell you this story, now this thing doesn't ask me anymore because they became big, but I don't, and so the story I'd like to tell you this afternoon.
Words were made to get out of their mouth.
Anyway, the years pass, the child becomes a young man, but he suffers a lot about this problem of bubbles, it's so much that he proves to find psychologists, all the great people, great professionals, but no one can choose this uncertainty.
One day, a trip to Rome is like this for pure fortune.
He found a old girl, called Teresa.
I'm sorry.
And this old man says to the young man.
When?
One day.
Would you expect a child?
Anything happens.
Don't be afraid.
So much so that everyone around me said, "Madre Teresa, but what a beautiful word of freedom!
Instead, it's...
The young man thought,
I'm not.
Interesting.
To these words of freedom, I want freedom for my words.
Anyway.
They still happened in the years, and the dream of this young man was to become a comic actor.
Instead, it became an informatic engineer.
Because it was much easier to digitalize words in front of a computer.
What is to recite words in front of a audience?
But a good day, in the pity of his country, they were paying a big party with a channel and a microphone there, in the middle, now you can imagine what a microphone means for a comic actor.
But imagine what a microphone means for a bubble.
But the desire of this young man to try the battles he had written, the comic battles were too big, and he didn't think, he came out of the scenery, he saved everyone, he was an informal engineer, think that my first words were, "web, web, web ..." That's exactly how, people were laughing.
And he was happy because words were able to flow in the water.
It was a magic.
It happened something extraordinary, but the most beautiful thing.
What is this young man?
At that moment, it was that people ...
They no longer laugh.
From him.
But they came with him.
So, at this point, one of my daughters would ask me, "Yes, Dad, we understood that you're you."
(Laughter) And then, even if you've forgotten, I've talked about fragility, but you've forgotten to say about power, then I'd say, "Yes, guys, this is a little the problem of having the eco-centric dad," I'd say the mother, but the power comes to us.
It happened something strange.
The people I had in front of me seemed more available, more kind.
In other words, they took out the best of themselves.
What is a moment, I'm talking about my disabilities, and they take out the best part.
And if it also worked the opposite.
It's then.
They became volunteer in a house that opens people with disabilities.
But it worked.
It worked: people I met and who became part of my life have pulled out and are really pulling the best part of me.
And this is wonderful.
Well, but...
Like in all the stories that are respected.
There's always a difficult moment, a bubble moment.
And why?
Believe me, finding a disability can make a little fear.
But for those who are parents.
I'm becoming a father.
Generating.
Disability.
Well, that one.
It's the biggest of fear.
And then the scene changes, and we go to the Civil Hospital of Padova, we are invited, me and my wife, who is in Cinta, a doctor makes us bother in a very small stadium with a wonderful light to the neon, where there was only seed, and makes my wife bother.
He takes the paper and read.
Trisomy.
21:00pm.
At that point, for me, time is closed.
And the only one I have in my ears.
They are the words of that battle of calculation.
Dombia Freite.
Not to be afraid.
But the genius body is my wife, who says, "Yes, Doctors know, but our son is a mask and a female," (Laughter) the doctor says, "Scuse, ladies, maybe she didn't understand, sadness is 21st century."
My wife answered, "I've understood very well, but I only wanted to know if our child is a mask or a female."
The teacher is always more sponsor, close.
It's a female.
(Laughter) So I asked myself, "But pork, misery, we're not even any time able to do the mask from Niela, but it's summer, and the doctor has given the seed to the doctor, because it's funny."
(Applause) We talk a lot about this, but I assure you it was, of course, a very difficult moment, maybe the hardest of our lives, even because I don't know if you've understood it, but we're not superheroes, even after a few months.
(Applause) And even the best thing that Anna has brought in our families, and what you've understood is that it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's that there's all the people who, in some way, meet, and if it's not power to this.
But we noticed one thing: that all the people we meet are very informed from the technical point of view of disability, especially from Dan's syndrome, we are all hundreds of speeds, we know everything, but few, very few of these people have had meetings with people.
So, to put together a little about these things and tell our story, we decided to open a Facebook page called "Boone news" and "Second Anna," where, without taking us too much seriously, but just for nothing, elderly, I'll say.
(Laughter) Or another one, where he says, "But it's true that sometimes you use, but you've done this card where Anna says, "But it's true that sometimes you use Dan's signs, and you don't know if we talk about Down syndrome, or you know, it's simply a chromosome in more, you've done an example, you've presented the TED."
Let's add a small X.
(Laughter) (Applause) Because I'll give you this example, because today, to know TED, to talk to people, you've done a bit of factics, so I invite you to not avoid the encounters of disability that you'll have in your life, either personal, but also of the people around you, a little recommendation.
In this journey, we can lose, because our tendency is always the one to put us one gradually.
A gradually below, here to look at the eyes, you have to put yourself in the same level, and in this sense, I often like to lose myself, for this, I like a politician to leave the bathrooms with this segment.
That in the language of segments is the word "disability."
So it doesn't make you want to look for disabled traits.
In your life.
To welcome them.
And above all.
Remember?
That fear.
What were you able to look at the face?
They are transformed into courage, thanks to real hearts.
(Laughter) I thought that to make the revolution, I would like to be a particular character, a kind of mouse, that goes to Gandhi, and then a beach, in fact, in a very simple way, has changed my life.
And from that moment on, I decided that what I would have done, what would have been a bit to change perspective, and from that moment on, I decided that what I would have done, what would have been my mission in the world, but for an orchestra, it would have been to no longer give anything to failure.
And trying to make the world a little more sustainable, starting from food.
But why food?
The food?
And not only, so it's a question of choice, but it's also a question of environmental impact, because our choices, maybe the way we decide, for us, for our family, every single day, or how we move for the city.
That's why I believe it's important to be, if not another perfectly aware of the choices that are done every day, and maybe try to change something, start a small revolution, if possible.
And it's very simple, rather, it's something good sense, and it's to optimize, I'll say that almost a word that refers to domestic economy, that has the environmental impact, but I think it's a very simple thing that can be applied to the lives of every day, especially to what is our relationship with food.
The concept of consumption, optimizing consumption, and especially the way we compose the tattoo every day, the tattoo, so what do we effectively take to the table?
The scars, I'm part of this project, so from the encounter with the car, just from the first subjects, but I don't mean to recover these things from the rejections, or to have a less than 50 percent, of winter, we get to do what we're doing now, every day at home, when we pull the green, and to separate them from a part there's the scarce, so the less noble part, I can see it as a single one.
OK, a mum, but I can also see it as a group of four ingredients.
For example, the dust?
For simplicity, I've made cycles, but I'd also be able to cut it natural, make a tortage, the bubble.
Maybe I'm eating it like this, or it's scared, and it's a fantastic tattoo that's understood, for example, the zuck really likes me a lot, because the mouth is the real part that we all have at home, and that we don't have a look, and that we can also do it for the health, but not only with a different eye.
In particular, the gardens, but all the times I use a domestic reader like the wildlife, every time I'm returning to the shadow, but it's a very high cup, it's enough temperature, so it doesn't happen that you can simply use the wave and all the times that you've been stuck, how do it?
A very practical example: take a glass like this, it must be thermal, put it in a new space, cover a lot of proteins, you eat a lot of patterns and you've chosen, and you'll be fantastic, because it's collected at the bottom, you'll get a result that's hard, it's hard, it'll be full of a lot of squares like always, and then you'll be full of patterns.
And really, when they could see the table, for example, the meat and the fish, because it's a problem, it's a problem, because, in fact, if we eat too much patterns or too slowly, that can be from the legs to the fish, in fact, we're affording the risk of developing some paths, but if we put ourselves in the opposite pieces.
In other words, riding them, being able to decrease the environmental impact on our health, but also in terms of public spirit for society, I think it would be more effective to try to convince you a little effort from all of you to have a little less protein in the pipe, that would be more possible to privilege the animals that have a low environmental impact.
What I'll be asking you, well, in other words, we're not a country of insects, and I believe that hardly we'll be able to use it, I'm talking about the opposite aspects that are with me today, or of the future, and I think I can't produce them at home, and that for more, any of us, I can produce them.
I'm a gurm product that is part of the Italian tradition.
In the room, who of you has never eaten the lights?
Okay, who would never eat them?
You see, probably ten years ago, this number would have been inferior, we would have had more human producers, about 35 years ago, a leg has prevented us from collecting them, we were not only to feed them, but also because they are used for the cosmic and for other uses, but it's a food that, even for 35 years, has prevented us from collecting them.
So simple, but I'm a very optimistic person, and I ask you a small change of prejudice: I'm aware that, in fact, to have you if it's another question, there are more people in the room who eat them and less than they wouldn't eat them, or they can take them from the ova, and then feed them with the vegetable scars.
I brought two data with me.
One, in a community with six facts, numerated by one to six, the other went with ten facts: if I throw it any value from one to ten to the same probability of getting out.
Now we play, you've launched the data of ten facts: I, the one of six, I've got this game undertaken an equal number or bigger than mine.
So, seven to five, compliments, you've come to play, win with the 10 facts is easier.
(Laughter) But do you know how to tell me, approximately, what is your probability of winning this game?
I'll explain to you: I can start repeatingly the data and take notes of every victory: after 100 laps, I'll realize that the victory will get closer to 75 percent.
With the increase of roots, my stone based on the media of successes becomes more precise: this, besides being intuitive, is guaranteed by the leg of large numbers.
This kind of approach has a mathematical problem, the resolution of a mathematical problem is called "Metdo Monte Carlo," for this ability to get to launch 100 million data in one single second, then we can do a computer.
It's a very powerful method, we can stimulate a launch of data, but also the behavior of a fluid, or the evolution of a colony of battery of an epidemic, or even the challenge of financial interests.
To give the answer to the data game, we didn't need any mathematics, a pure mathematician would repeat the Motor Monte Carlo as if we were abused of the brutal strength of computer science.
(Laughter) For me, it seems rather a way of magic.
And that's why, four years ago, I started my PhD in Monte Carlo, at the University of Borrik in Inghilterra.
Now I'll give you the data.
(Laughter) I don't want to talk about mathematics today, I want to tell you a captain of my story.
The workplace is an ordinary day, and the two teachers who follow me are of an exceptional, or my job, a supercomputer, unfortunate and unthinkable intelligence, exhausted after the first week of PhD.
But the doctor doesn't do it for everyone: it's often frustrating, then it's based on innovative research, behind every speaker, there are 1010 failed attempts.
But the doctor can be a lonely path.
(Laughter) I spend most of my time alone in front of the computer or in a statistical article.
(Laughter) To face these obstacles, it would be a very lonely passion that I wasn't planned.
So, while I move, I look like a term served on a plate of argument for a mathematician who studies the summer, but I can guarantee you that at that moment my mind was more than fertile, paralyzed.
(Laughter) A few months after the doctor's beginning, I started to teach.
I was so thesis, think of teaching mathematics and English for the first lesson of 40 minutes I prepared more than two weeks.
But with that first lesson?
If there was a fire inside me, of determination, motivation, finality, everything I had before was missing, and why?
I didn't care to answer this question, I started to live in lessons and I wasn't enough to be, I wasn't going to be a single preparation, I wanted to appreciate my students to get them back to the first year, to more than eight hours on the most advanced costs, I tried to enjoy every opportunity.
And then, for me, it wasn't work.
To stop the lesson is a creative or stimulating process, a form of art.
(Laughter) Let me take the students' ideas, just make mistakes they are, take a continuous learning, and then there's the moment of performance in class becomes a show.
And the classroom, to my ocean, the lesson of my sponsorship.
In fact, in the students of paying entirely all my practice, I was also talking about a specific recognition: the University of Warich taught me the award for excellence in the lesson, as a young researcher.
In my PhD, I've got so many satisfactions, but this resonated inside me in a different way, it was all so natural, beautiful, winning, in my little child, I was experiencing something that goes to the long scale.
The most authentic and genuine way to achieve success and accomplishment is to take advantage of their passions.
At that point, I looked back to everything that had happened in so little time, until I got to that question, the first day of lesson, do you remember that fire, that explosion of determination?
(Laughter) The answer I gave myself is in my way of being and in values I grew up with, and the values we all grew up with.
It's the culture of sharing.
There are objects or abstract goods that, if they've been born among more people, they've started to get rid of such a scavenger.
A concert?
Well, TED is this event, or a song, a book, a trip, a passion, a talent, happiness.
Among these goods, there is also knowledge.
I had found the value and passion for knowledge in the sharing of knowledge.
And my mind will be in this movement for me, in the moment I had tried to move the lies of my students.
(Laughter) In In In Inghilter, it was a fantastic experience: now I'm writing my PhD thesis, I'm just defining in the next months, and that's how I decided my next step in which mathematics and communication are found to give life this magic of sharing of knowledge.
I've told you this capital of my story, just because I think that what we learned is shared, or finding finality through the roads that there were no expectations, and then certain passion, like the catalyst of our talents, and the culture of sharing.
There's one last thing I want to share with you: and to do it?
I invite you to read.
It's a preparation lesson of financial exams: there are more than 100 students in class, a girl in the first row asked me if I can give some indices on the demands of the disaster, and if I'm fine the microphone, I'll give them my feet to the color.
Another young man, a little back, asked me where you can find other exercises to prepare yourself: it's true, we've had little time for practice, but there's a lot of materials on the Internet, and where I work, I wrote it on the challenge.
But they're satisfied, well, the show begins.
(Laughter) I wrote the bathroom, but sometimes I came to them to ask how to procedure, I've always prepared it, I've finished it, every point of practice, we need a very difficult element, but I've spent the Domenica on their book to ask them to take the breath.
It's a direction, it flies, I make the magnifying glass for the exams, a group of students sleep, someone asks clearly, but most of them are reassuring.
A last student approaches me: the smiling.
He hesitates in the bathroom, maybe he's looking for the right words.
And in the end?
I found courage, just to tell myself.
Returning.
But I just want to say thank you.
(Laughter) Because what do you do for us?
No one does it.
I have a huge smile and a even more giant heart, and I think that maybe I stay alone in the classroom is exactly the opposite to this world.
So, I want to tell you, "My hearts are salty legs, and for this reason, when the mind is moving, even the heart beats you inside the bed, I'm in my heart and movement, thank you.
It's officially started the month of November, we make a selfie, and we share it, "Stake the Trento," "Movender," by asking our love to donate the Mrs. Globo's move, to Trento, to Tedarch Cirrento, to the Bach's Sco's Star, to the scope of Promover, to promote the dialogue, and to make them grow their own public public public public public publicity, to a few 9 million squares, and to the windows, and start to move the windows, to the window, and to the window of the windows's.
Good morning everyone, today I want to tell you how a bottle of birds has changed my perspective on leadership.
I was in the United States, I was doing masters research, and so a little bitmer, I came to a bar, I carried a book.
And as it often captures me, while I read, while I read one thing, I started to listen to other conversations, there was, in front of me, a copy that was talking about change, he said, "We have to change your attitude, no, you have to do this."
It was a central theme: in the morning, my colleagues presented it in a very clear way.
What's interesting about the change is that, as I told you before, the collection.
We all face the change as if it were the most normal thing, they tell you that you have to change, which is normal, that you have to do something, but, in fact, when you approach the change, the first thing you have is beyond fear.
And you feel your diversity, you experience your diversity, you feel far from the goal.
You feel that in this change there are many people, in the morning there are many people with different intelligences, each one of which has more intelligences, and you're there to measure yourself and say, "Well, but now what do I do?"
AC: It seems that from this issue of change, which is the most normal thing, in fact, you don't know exactly how to get out of it, and the opportunity seems to be here, instead of diversity, to integrate.
All that has put me differently, I remember, one day, my daughter, Carola.
It's a mom at home, we had a friends' company, "Gey, then at some point the machine says, "Dad, but why Alessandro Luigi are two men, I say, "Clo, we're really three men, and she says, "No, no, no, no, you're with mom!"
So, this diversity, in fact, is precisely called milk.
To do something different.
(Laughter) But to build, to modify, to find a sense answer, and this is a bit the difficulty, because if, on one hand, I want to create a culture of change, on the other, I need to create leaders of change, that I've worked for many years inside companies, I've been taking care of consulence, so I keep working with companies and with people.
So, always drinking this birds, at some point I started to write, I'm always in the United States, to write a paper, the word change, to sing this word change, I start to think that it brings me these words and form a cake.
(Applause)
Katch!
Because in fact, it's just a prison, it's a bit the attitude that, for me, of course, this is a perspective of all personal, a leader today must have, that is to know how to take, but to be present and guide the change, to the hunger is an agent creative, of transformation and change.
So, what's the new element here, for me, at least, the new element?
It's precisely in the dimension of not only change, we're often called to manage change, meaning management.
And then, in fact, what happens to us is precisely to do something else.
So the perspective is the change of perspective that...
But I thought about doing this leap from doing things, recovering the rules, making the projects, bringing people from one part to the other to be, and all this made them thanks to what, to the development of the creative thinking, which is a little the law that makes this transformation move.
(Laughter) Because in doing this, if it's true that I work on myself, on the other hand, I'm afraid to be afraid.
But I also give myself the permission to explore, to imagine new things, a little the ability to dream, to this model we have imagined it through five...
Fundamental pillars: the first one knows where the transformation is.
Each one is creative in their own way.
And finally, we don't talk more about creativity as something related to talented people, to geniuses, exclusively to artists, or to someone who, maybe, in business, takes care of marketing, rather than communication, but creativity is something that everybody looks at, has the context in which you find.
(Laughter) And if this is true?
It's also true that you can learn, you can align your creativity, what you do with the creative thinking, try to work on divergent thinking and convergent thinking, but this is not enough.
To make a movement a little deliberate, when you're aware of your emotions, you can allow you to feel with fear, that when you feel that you don't have the courage, and to make the leap, which is the emotional sphere, the sphere of emotions, we've decided to talk about emotional intelligence before, here to reach the judgment.
And to get rid of it, instead, in a generation of opportunities.
And the interesting thing is to do this.
It's not that you're indifferent to the context, that is to say that those who have done these passengers, for only to get hurt in Italian field, surely deserve major global extension, just for innovation, and it's increased by 60 to 7 percent.
The real transformations look at, as I said, inside, but also an impact in the context where your operations are, and so the third point is to work to create in a responsible way.
Opportunity, we say, to create the climate, but in fact, I'm not so much for the idea of managing, but how much to nourish, because the real difficulty today is in supporting the leader to identify that with their behaviors can generate...
Something that has a concrete impact inside organizational contents, what do I mean?
That feeding means that every day you build the context in which people can fight on ideas, they can have a free spirit, they can relate to each other.
But they can also allow themselves to fail, and this is not so simple in organizational contents, because there's always the Libya of the results, as if the results were achieved in only one way, but to give them the opportunity to do what, to explore new facts.
And to do this, it's not so immediate: then you don't know why we grow up with an imaginative spirit that is a child to imagine something immediately, if you ask him an adult.
Well, there's a bit of competition, but I say it or I don't say it, the drawing I've done, maybe it's not exactly the best, better than I don't say it, better than I'm in silence, I start all this inner dialogue, then what's interesting when we find ourselves in this situation, how do I do I do it?
Give me to collect the creative spirit.
It's here.
Specially, the impact you have when you do this, when you try to dream, has an impact that is not necessarily based on reinventing the very client's relationship, because the perspective is completely changed, then to return to that initial birds.
So, the idea is exactly.
To be able to do a paradigm, change their own paradigm, that is, what?
To find yourself in the situation of being aware.
To align the creative spirit, but to put ourselves in a way of liberated, to say, "In which way I can be curious, in which way, looking at people, I can find something that is not so unknown."
So the sense of the tension we've seen before in the video is, as the guide is the flywheel for the development of the creative thinking, but this clearly presents.
The courage, on one hand, to create physical spaces where all this is possible, but above all, to create a mental space, an emotional space, that is to give the permission.
To make things happen before you.
And then, in a few words, the courage to dare, thank you.
But we're going to land.
To wake up the security belts.
How many times will you be able?
And it's the only time it has the chance to see from the top.
The most amazing, the most powerful, the most broadcast invention.
From humans.
The city.
And it's also the only time you've surely understood how to think, but how is it possible?
What millions of people!
For thousands of years.
Try these places to stay together, they're massive.
They choose to live not all separated, but together in what we call the city.
And will you also go through the head?
An important question, but is it positive or negative all this?
But would it be better to potential this phenomenon?
Or to limit it.
And this is a story that goes back in time, in fact, this is Manchester.
In 1845, it was the biggest most populated city of the West.
And as you can see, maybe it's not winning, and in fact, in this city.
I started what I call.
The longest process of history.
With the more unexpected sentence.
And the process?
And of course, the process has the cities.
And they started these two kids, then became quite famous: Kar Marx and his friend Hangel.
They were passing for Manchester.
And they didn't see what you understand today when you do your weekend in New York or in Parigi.
Imagine.
They saw streams, without leaves, poverty for everything.
Following, but not the one of today, the true smoke that was like this.
That carbon particles prevented the view of one with the other.
And of course, both wrote with the book.
It was called "the condition."
It's the operating class in the cities.
In which the city accused, of all the bad guys in the world, was the city to be the cause of the investigation, of insecurity, of poverty, of all the bads in the world.
And there's no other way.
That limiting this phenomenon to the possible was like saying...
A Malsano attitude.
Something necessary sometimes, but to contain, and that's why?
In the year's course, we're from 1850, at the beginning of Novecento.
It's also the discipline of the tools to limit this phenomenon given that it probably causes the cause of all the problems of the world.
I'm born from science.
Urbanism.
What do you see here behind?
Something...
The tremendous thing you may know, some time you've met, that has some bizzar tools: you're called a bizzar instrument, you have to do hundreds of practices.
The pianification, the piano, that is, the idea that someone from the top can imagine.
The future of a city in the next 50 years, only him is only in his head, or even for the last reason that you haven't met, everyone, but that I can even say.
And to pretend to imagine in a centimeter of the city what must happen in the future, here in a house.
Here's a job.
Here's a theater.
And then?
Let's also imagine the movies, the culture that is very exposed against the city.
It's famous a movie, a series of movies in the 80s, fuel in New York, fuel of Los Angeles.
Where do they Manhattan?
It became an uncontrollable island.
A city full of violence?
And as much as abandoning it, and maybe because you've seen the film, remember, it becomes a prison where all the world's senses are launched from the top and scanned for yourself.
The interesting thing about this process.
It's that, like all processes, this was also for the Italy a little bit far from 1845, it's about 20 years ago.
The sentence came.
"Yes."
The only thing in science, such a sentence, is a feeling of total solution.
Not only reading the motivations of this sentence.
It's discovered that the city is not the cause of everyone in the world, but even the growth of the population.
That one.
It's the solution.
To all the great questions that are affected by the human genius.
Democracy.
The investigation, the environmental sustainability.
Squality is the economic development, the creation of work.
The ability?
To create.
Knowledge.
In fact, this sentence also brings three.
Imports?
The elements that motivate this ability that the city.
To improve the world.
It's the density, you can see which my spices, my photo made from the top of my city.
The density, that is, how many more people, how many more activities, how much more imaginations can be in the same method, much more this positive effect is verified, and the second is diversity.
In other words, the fact that there are not only many things in a small place.
But that many things are different.
That there are rich people, people of all the countries in the world, people who love soccer, others that, like me, also ignore the name of the most famous soccer.
And the third element is creativity.
This is a white night, where thousands of people, for a beach, wear a boat, a series at home, food and stay together in a beach.
The creativity is this ability to imagine in cities.
Let's do it!
Here's my idea: that the city, in the end, is solved, in some way, addressed as a solution.
It's actually a mechanism.
The definition of the city is no longer.
The greatness, the inhabitants, we are all used to confront this city for the inhabitants, for the bigness, for the product, right?
The city is a mechanism.
The city works, it solves.
The great questions of humanity?
Because it's like a black scenario.
A great mechanism that transforms.
Interesting different.
So many individuals that come from stories.
From regions that have different goals.
That if you take a trip together in a car, they would tackle it all day.
However, the city can easily transfer, magically, such individual interests in collective well-being, and so the definition of cities is no longer a static definition.
The city saves the world as much as it can generate this positive transformation mechanism, and so it's a city that can also lose its status.
Now we all know some cities in Italy, even big.
"Why?"
Maybe in this moment?
After a thousand years of history, these abilities have suspicious temporary.
Wow, maybe!
Neglete, maybe never considered that, instead, at this moment, or for the previous ones?
They can be.
This virtuous mechanism.
And then we don't have to be afraid of the city.
We must go from there.
Students of content of the urban phenomenon, mechanisms and tools that accelerate development, and I'll give you two examples.
It's the work I've been conducting in these last years.
And they don't have fear.
It's the Cuban phenomenon.
But what?
Try it!
It feeds you this mechanism.
Spreading the big one.
Com Utopia and courage, the first example.
It's from Milan.
And this is an image from the top of the city.
From the satellite?
And they are evident of some parks, not everyone.
A group of green, little known, in the center of the city, ten minutes ago.
From the owner?
Who's together?
And this is my idea.
And this is also the journey I've done.
For years with this map, I went to the city.
"Liber" is said.
It's a name.
This group of green, with courage, because it creates in the city.
Like the urban stage, bigger than the world, 72 green kilometers, a vital park that every day can be traveled, as I did, and what?
By going, for example, to see the maps of the city, you can imagine how the element of diversity and strength.
Creating.
In the positive things, in the systems we live in.
Don't let us say...
Studying.
From the traffic retoric, which is still 9 cents.
It's before the feeling of solution, of cities like names.
To repeat the cement.
I don't know if you all have in mind this one.
The second example is that.
A city.
A few billion kilometers from here.
It's worked, it's called Buenos Aires.
In Argentina, the capital was placed, a few years ago.
What to do with this city in 2030 with all spaventurated: Buenos Aires, more than in other countries, is the magnet?
From all the nation, the place where everyone searches a possibility.
But this mechanism, which is the definition of the city I've proposed to you, is in some way conceived.
Violence, poverty, also derivated from a bigger national crisis.
And what was the attempt?
Like Al solito.
The one.
Limitating in development, but with courage.
Speaking the big one, with the same.
The ability to believe in the power of this mental weapon, which are the cities?
Like with the habital park, even in the case of Buenos Aires, I proposed three strategies.
Three strategies?
Who welcomes the development?
And that you see here behind, a majority of anxieties, that is, a great population.
A majority of infrastructure, "What?"
The creation of green spaces, you can see this map.
It's density.
The piano says, in 2030, we must not limit ourselves, but increase a million inhabitants in more in the city, build.
Stubbing!
With more basic careers, with more dense careers.
It's called...
The population not only in Argentina, but in the whole world, is creative to gather.
And then, building a infrastructure system.
Also!
I'm sure they allow...
It's even more in this development to accelerate it, and then, as I said.
Spaces of sociality.
If the spaces?
Great and pedonal.
And this tragedy together.
They were put on the use of Buenos Aires.
It's about the cities.
I'm the solution to everyone to go to the world.
When?
Once again.
Let's land.
And Macáki.
choosing the place on the end, the drop from the top.
This great invention of humanity.
What is the city?
You'll have a different feeling in the heart and you'll know how to answer that question that you've asked you many times.
And maybe?
Would you be anxious?
To live in what I call the century of the cities.
(Laughter) The words are important.
They put us in a relationship.
It didn't go to our thought.
The worst of our language.
They're extraordinary, they're avoidant, they're full of stories of vibrations, of emotions, they're waves.
They are evocative, they resonate with our history.
And beauty is our language.
And in fact, this beauty is tutorated, preserved, perceived.
I'll talk to you again, I'll talk about the missing way.
From the English, the province, motivated, often dark.
But the Italian nor English, that for a few years.
It's starting to become common.
But did I take it a bit to the larvae?
And I'll start to show you.
Some lately motivations.
They have motorcycles on their teaches and the greatest universities in the world, and they show them with great pride: here we are in Australia, here we are a congress, and there's a Latin motto in Ghana, in Corea, in Duncia.
In Svetia, in the unit to the College of Rond, in the united Oxford window.
In Cicago, in the United States.
Hardad says, "Let's see in his teacher."
Not only the universities.
It's funny.
They will say, "If you're in Latin, eh!
London has a Latin motto.
Parigi has a Latin motto: "The Canada has a Latin motto."
The Kindland, in Australia, has a motorcycle, but not only: the American marine says, "If you've always heard it, in a thousand movies, the merit, the British girl talks in Latin, and even an institution, there's no grade to be a passatist, like NASA.
It gave a Latin motto to the Apollo emissions.
"Why am I doing so long with the Latin?"
And with the Latin motivations, because if there's a single place in the world, where a Latin motto could be there.
That's it.
That's it.
The cool!
From Latin.
"Yeah!"
Have you seen it?
So, what is the mark, touristic recent of the Rome city, proven and launched by the human municipality?
(Laughter) And this doesn't even understand how we have to pronounce it: "Room, me and me," "Wow, Mendyu," what is this ambition of Barça Lega, what is this contract, this circuit between two lights and meaning, each one, what are the five palles in the top?
(Applause) And one asks.
But because... (Laughter) But because when we look at all the malchitists of all the cities of the world, there's no one who does the unthinkable thing to store their name, to find themselves.
There's no leg.
Just dogma.
"Mapo, then you have your own feet."
We want to give a joke to the Tudistic power (Applause)
(Laughter) It's just launched by the Ministry of Benedito Vereibello, ready, (Laughter) "We don't like the English Italian, in a whole way, we don't even like the aglophons, the curious thing is this."
Mah.
Two style speaker, but we still talk about Italian, I mean, I'm talking about Italian, the most romantic language in the opposite world of Rolling mine and U.
I'm dying, the most dramatic language in the world, according to 120 linguists, in any case.
The fourth most studied language in the world and not studies in the Italian to do businesses: the studio because they love it for the kitchen, for fashion, for the art, for the story, for Dante.
Studying it for this.
We're talking.
We're talking about the language of the angels.
Second, you take nothing.
And I said, "Yes."
That's it.
For example, the pizza.
It has achieved the world continuing to call us.
The pizza.
(Video) Here you can see the map of pizzeria in the United States, confronted with the NEGO, with the quantity of the same map of businesses that sell Hamburgers or Otdoxon, the pizza comes.
So, if everyone eats.
And it says pizza.
Why do we here, in Italy, have Wine?
Let's see here: let's eat food, we drink wine, Lucca, the novel, Cathedania, Milan.
And the curious thing, because it's in New York.
(Laughter) If in the place of history they have to promote it in the week of the Italian wine, they say, "Because New York's restaurants."
Happy and elegant, who sell food and wine.
Do they say?
Deno.
Mah!
Let's talk about another Italian excellence.
Let's abandon food, let's talk about fashion.
This is what the biggest Italian journalist wrote: "The World Cross Frendley," directly from the passengers of the Flow Winter.
(Laughter) And well, we understood that the stages are no longer the ones once, but explain why I have to call a "being".
Donna Kurvy, as if it were a mountain road in Gran Canyon and it wasn't beautiful.
How are our goods formed?
And the women we see in our rhythm of birth.
Okay.
Remember.
But yes, sorry, they're not curious.
We want to talk about publicity, elderly, of advertising, this one.
It's the publicity payment of a novel in Spain and Palla, Spanish.
This is a publicity payment of beauty, of breastfeeding, and French palm.
This is the same page in Italy, and it's English, there are two only Italian words: the first one.
(Laughter) What's happening if, finally, the union?
(Laughter) We say, "Let's go to our radicies, we call ourselves, Landini, this: the union."
Reunion, the last Italian City, isn't it?
Audience: Yes.
We're sure, here's the curious thing, because beyond two Italians on two, we don't like a English word.
And 60% of 2012, we say, "This is not 508 so we don't know the English, we don't know it as a country, and we see it."
(Laughter) And here we have to wait for the medical skills of the gentleman who compiled this model of the island, they're supermarket, the linguistic skills, and yet, every day, for the prediction, for conformism, because it seems a model, because we're very winning.
Not deeply inserted in the Italian language, but also in accessories and useless.
We say "cool" instead of the phone, we say "location," instead of the place, I've heard of the nickname is the location that was accepted for the seed of a pattern.
(Laughter) We say "compilation competition," we say "castomer" of the beautiful ideas.
In the ufficies, we can feel that we must shout a scope of different fields of the disaster to satisfaction, (Laughter) with the united business.
(Laughter) When it would be enough to say, we need to call "Pepo Franco and Gennado" to put this farm of the sedentary clips, because then the business is always "People" and "Genal."
(Laughter) The English and the email don't only speak companies, but also the media, the public administration, the government.
(Laughter) We have a leg of the State called Jobsect, and I assure you that the fact that Jobset doesn't make it easier.
And I forgot the tennis players, which is a clothes that doesn't exist in nature, we would have done a bit of a house.
In English, there won't be more empathetic because there's a name in English.
That's it.
A couple of months ago, after the study of the human mark, I realized that I had to do something, communicate my dress, I invented two processes and tools that can be effective.
I thought, with the kids of my office, they put them in foot an initiative, and they say, "Dad."
To make a minimal sensibilization on this problem.
Thank you.
And without spending a sun, simply putting us a little bit of communication and work.
It's a bit of energy, this appetition?
That invited me.
Public administrations, the government, the companies, the media, to say it in Italian.
And at the same time, in the first instance, the Aclusca Academy, because it was facing this sensibilization utopia, we were waiting for us.
A discourse, but not what happened.
In less than a month they've signed, putting names with men, I say, and there are 70,000 people.
They signed youths, elderly, Poly Gloppies and people who don't like English, signed splending professionals and thought, "What's going to do in our language, and they signed Italian to the summer, saying, "What's going to do in our world?"
From Singapore, from Jerusalem, from Peru, South Africa and North Africa, from Canada, from Australia, it's something like a movement: I've spent hours!
Look at these movies that grew, and they read the motivations.
And you can see someone here: the Italian is a right, but also a duty, we are in a wooden novel, if we think correctly, we pay other changes, work in a public administration, help.
Film, because I've studied classic Liceo Classico, but I've worked with the economists, (Laughter) in fashion, I've had a list of risks and it's better than an English scenario, Sisher, and we know we're talking about it.
This is one of the most.
I'm stupid, I have a new plan, but I'm talking about the Italian, "Thank you, go to Rome."
First, because I started to lack science in our language, because I never wanted to say, I felt a year and a funeral that spends the occasion.
(Applause) Even for Dante, for Montal, for Caproni, for Paese, for Bianjarti, Bernata, I'm stubborn to feel relationships that don't know how to say "Boxon of the Table," but they fill the company's mouth, but that's how it happens.
I say, because I don't think those who say "cool" are cool.
(Laughter) Film, because I've heard professors, universities that say displayed, instead of visualizing, "I'm filming, because I'm not the English.
(Laughter) First, because I decided to understand what politicians say who ask my vote.
And now that someone could finally take this initiative, I'm 85 years old, thanks to the motors, here I said, a extraordinary echo transversal, because mass media has taken this thing in red.
They don't amplify it.
And this initiative is used in other 130 articles on the Italian journals, with a transversal and unimaginable consensus: they have spoken together grams and serves on the public stadium, but the reward, with great applause, even in Italy and the avenue.
She told me, "Where are you?"
And he spoke Friday.
He spoke to me about Christian family, he spoke to me about Turing's menchine, he spoke to me today that the virtual fact is a trial, a transversality.
"What?"
And it's all the construction water, also a little bit of here and a little bit in it, and that it's going to the depth of the roofs, more than nicks and colors, to the most popular ones.
And I'm a great desire to replicate ourselves with the desire and the consciousness of our language: these things are finished in the newspapers, I've also touched me to put my food on the ship, and I've been interested in an Australian radio, as a lady.
So, we need this.
And all this?
It's something that is born from the consciousness of each of us, because language is what we build at every moment of our talk, of our thinking, and of our writing every day.
So the hair is ...
Let's all have the Italian streams.
And what about it?
In conclusion, some reason to do it: to operate the Italian test, it helps us understand from everyone, and it's a fact of democracy, because it's understood a fact of democracy.
They don't want us rules, they don't want us, they want us good examples.
And you have to ask the situations to give the good example.
Our language is everything: it's a value, it's a fact of your emotion, we have to sell it, spend it in the world, because it represents us, and know more crazy, we touch every doubt.
It's beautiful, it also protects the brain, more than a language, but who knows the language, uses one at the same time.
In English, besides all, we've seen it, it's easy to talk, and so those who pay it, as they eat, speak better.
And then, this duty is all read.
In the first of the interests of this day, the Leonardo who defined himself: "Homo, without literary."
Because he wrote in return, in Italian.
Always, the structure, the way of science.
It's a Italian language.
It helps us express our creativity, if we give up to express our language, we give up one of the peculiarities.
Of the dishes.
Of the magnificent!
Potenciality.
From our Italian creativity, which is the decade in its mother language.
And even if our linguistic tissue is solid, can we pick up some strangers of carity?
But we must take the dance to a tissue that is not broadcast and exhausted.
From sixth grade to an excess.
"Determinist, no, misunderstanding."
Why do I tell you this?
Because the Italian is us, the Italians.
With our identity, our radicies, our history.
Our opening to the world that goes through our words, thanks.
What does a young Karghiver mean?
When a person wants to start being bad, the attention is on that person, on their needs, but if that person, even something that doesn't go to your mom, or to your dad, what happens?
What happens to you, if when I breastfeed, or in exchange, I started to stay if I still had a teenager, when I was a teenager, I didn't have the idea of being a young woman in Karghiver, as everyone went to school, I asked them to shake their friends, but what is there behind these photos?
That you don't see.
Before telling you the hidden part of the iceberg, I would like to take a step back, to start...
Always from the beginning.
If I asked you what has changed, what's the same?
A tsunami called health problem, and when it affects one of the generators, and it's still a child, a teenager, they're your points of reference, becomes really complicated until then.
And if I told you that the health problem?
Is it a mental disorder problem?
The affection for a child can be very heavy, and it can be made of sense of harp, love, hatred that alternate, unfortunately, fear, rabia, sadness, constant feeling of walking on the ova, an excessive care of responsibility.
And the difficulty to focus?
It's also the duty to take care of the domestic facts, like making the spirit, or knocking freelines, are smaller lines, or talking to the doctors and managing therapy, but, in addition to this, you could be victim of bullism, maybe because no one has prepared to do it.
But in addition to all this?
To continue, also to make the life of always, to go to school, to study, the reason why I'm here today is that it's added another meat, which is often not being able to talk to anyone.
If we say that your mom or your child, a problem of physical health, a tumour, another physical pathology, will hardly consider someone genetically committed and destined in automatic, to erase the same disorder.
But if you try to say that your mom or your dad have a higher depression, a bipolar disorder or if there's no DNA to describe their behavior and say, "Mom, dad, something that doesn't go, the answer of the external world will be completely different."
Even today, in the whole world, the physical health, the mental health, is not perceived as a common good that belongs to all of us, and this brings a rhythm to understand what happens inside us and their love, urge to ask and receive help often not to receive a cure.
The climate that we perceive around you is the difficulty to communicate inside and then the family, the stigma, the prejudice, the shame, can I bring you to having everything inside and not say exactly anything: How did I face the situation?
What's left behind those photos that wasn't visible behind that smile, there was a heart that came to form in automatic, behind which I was hiding a ice cream that allowed me to have inside fear and pain, to avoid that I brought people around me, to continue to do the same time.
There was also a cry of help, a cry of help that couldn't be able to get out that nobody, even at school, imagined.
When the first grade started in the Internet, on the forms, the stories of other children, of other countries, thanks to the love for the lights that we've lived with mental disorders, are all different, all unique, but there's one thing that I've been able to open to me, and that we've also helped me to individual people around me, people, around me, the retirements, that could be different, we don't talk.
Through the stories of children, activists, proven from Australia, the United States and Carada, I couldn't give a name to emotions I had tried and understand that they were natural to the reactions I had lived, but I could also see the positive characteristics.
And so I took the first flight in terms of everyone, because in other ways, that encounter was a huge owner, that gives me energy to Carlo and Marco, we made the first Italian association, created by children, for other children, and it's called "People who don't have a voice," to help them, to bring them to children from their children, to their parents's parents, they start to suffer from a mental disorder.
And it's a project that came from the bottom, thanks to crowdfunding, thanks to the help of people next to me, some of them have believed in this same desire, they've given us the child, of their disorder, and they're not even in the cure, for their disorder, and also these kids, we have to think, I've been one of them for a period.
At first, when I thought about this project, during a walk, in ten minutes, the story, and now we were able to get to many regions, I was talking to the students, to move the institutions to do more for us, but also the civil society, and to find so people of the civil society that maybe didn't have lived in our positions, and to bring a donation of our part of our part of our own, to the library library.
To be able to see a wedding of the attacks, to face those that are the positive and negative emotions, the challenges of life, starting to take care of before it's too bad.
It's a long and tortuous path, what we have in front of us.
It's done something I know.
It's that one of the characteristics that for us wasn't opened, we'll make it make your desire, even thanks to you, is the will to change the state of scope, and that's why I know that the girl will make us enter the light, thank you.
Audience: Yes.
Today I want to talk about a special person: Aaron Sfarz, when they have dedicated them to a documentary last year in 2014, they've intitulated it "The Internet on boat," the pupil of the Internet.
But it's very difficult to put together in precise categories: it was a activist, a programmer, a researcher, Aaron, at 14 years old, was in the group that wrote the rests, maybe you don't say much, but he was a bubble in the block until ten years ago.
(Laughter) And to build, at 15 years, the "como" creative, dealing with the technical part, today the "commons" are about in a billion content, they are free licenses, they create the most flexible and open copyright, for example, the license of Wikipedia.
Aron, at 20 years old, becomes a small start-up to build something to co-found something called reddit, becomes a millionaire, from one day to the other, but to do what has always done: to build a free Internet, collaborative, collaborative memory archives.
And it becomes one of the protagonists of the fight against "soppa," a valuable leg that a few years ago costs even Wikipedia to do "shopper" to go to Blockchain, because it would have limited the freedom of expression on the Internet.
(Laughter) What Nareon absolutely harvests is an extraordinary and fertile theory: all the wisdom of the economy, the political theory, the history of education to computer science.
It was spinning with the capital of March under the arm at 16.
(Audience) Yes!
Aron and this tells us about her brother at a very tough moment of the documentary that you absolutely have to see, and she had learned to learn prestigiously, she told us her mother who, at some point, was cooking, and aaron had two and a half years and a half, was sitting in this gel, and she had just seen her on the fridge, who had just attacked her friends.
But they discovered something important: this kind of knowledge has a spectrum, its owner, that is, fame of knowledge becomes a fame of sharing knowledge, because knowledge must be shared.
If we look at the aron projects, we see that they are all tools and technologies for access to information.
In the CIV Internet preserve memory, the RSSS allowed the blogs to synchronize themselves, the comfortable creatures are a copyright, so they make accessible to the people of content, the creative content.
The access to information is born from a very simple thing, but fundamental, for the bank, which is to give access to information to people, it means making a democratic act, our democracy literally is based on giving access to learning, to education, without this there is no democracy.
It's an act of empowerment, of ability to others.
And the fact that Aron came to this?
As a genius, this comes from its cultural retrospect, which is the one of the hacker, the "laker" as a constructor, not as a writer.
You know the code and you have the skills to read it, you can change it, you can make it yours, you can do what you want.
But to explain the world becomes a necessary condition to get the world, to make it unbearable, to be able to change it.
Thank you very much.
To make the world a better place presents.
A access to this information.
So if all institutions are social, they are made of people, so they are fundamentally culture, so they are fundamentally made of words.
This becomes hackable at the moment.
Do you know the code and know how it changes?
But this thing doesn't do it by itself.
If we make the world open, everyone can add it, make the world a little better, it doesn't become an act of eroism, but it becomes an act of collective construction.
Audience: Yes.
Neither him.
In 2011, Aaron's literature is interested in this thing called Open Hazes, a great movement for free access to scientific literature.
They have the keys to be able to make scarce what scarce is not, that is, scientific information.
(Laughter)
It's passionate about the subject, it writes this thing called Open Higgery or Manifesto, and it writes it among the other here in Italy: the first phrases were power information.
Audience: Yes.
Around scars dozens of thousands of articles, hundreds of thousands of articles from a academic Data, Gestor.
It's scholarship.
She had waited for her.
It's not a genius attack, it's not surely not seen, it understands that its opportunity to make a Aaron.
An example.
They want to give an example condemn to show all the hackers out there that the world doesn't change with a rich couple of code.
Audience: Yes.
"Yes."
It has been made of a real and its judgmental persecution, to have scared hundreds of thousands of articles from the academic and could do it, but not in such a scale, and it has been answered for 35 years, it spends millions of dolls in this legal cause.
And it's more or less equipped with a terrorist.
Two years later, his first rest, Aaron felt like, at home, in New York, she was 26 years old.
The point is that power knows it, that information is power.
And if I decide to be the engrance that holds the system, well, these will scholize you with all the combined force of the engrenage around you.
It's something we've already seen recently, with Edward Snowden, Germany, Giulia Nassange, all different cases, pure similar, people who wanted to give access to information, for how much against it.
And I'd like to make you see now a minute, from the last year's interview, a few months before dying.
I'm a teacher, I'm a teacher, and now I'm going to talk to you about this.
I've also put all the titles and it's coming.
I said, "That's why I'm going to talk to you." (Laughter) I think it's a bit like that.
He doesn't.
If you don't have time to think about it, you'll have to write it on a barrier, you'll have to write it on your forehead, or you'll have it, you'll have to write it on the streets for "Cackking Challenge" or "Say".
Let's think about it.
Right?
The line is in Boston, it's in the middle of the month, it's in the machine.
We're going to say that we're going to build a new world.
They are exhausted: these mechanisms of winter and non-speaking.
"You're a boss."
The last year, we started to think, "This is good for you to have to be a businessman, but it's not just a video game."
There's a fundamental bank here.
There are two polarized perspectives of Internet: the Internet is horrible.
The platform of mass sponsors is used to sponsor, to control, to express, and in fact these things are the same: the Internet is fantastic, free, a place of total freedom of expression, and in fact these things are the same way: it's too complex to be just one thing.
I don't know what to do.
It was an important thing: Zaptuas depends on us what will come from, because the Internet will always be this complicated thing.
I don't compare my own because I don't have, but I have some more good words.
In doing living things, it's not something that will be: if there's one, it's what's already here, the hell we live every day, that we train together.
Two ways are to not suffer.
And the first one is easy for many: accept the hell and become part of it, until the point of not seeing it anymore.
The second risk requires attention and learning continues.
Trying and knowing who is what, in the midst of the hell, is not hell, and making it last and give them space.
Good afternoon everyone, then, in 1950, while I was eating with some physical colleagues in the mess of the Lausalamus laboratory, and I was improvised, I solved the look of the tattoo.
He asked.
where all of you are, and I didn't talk about other comments, I was thinking about the extraterrestrials.
It was a peace, no, I had done a reasoning: in our galaxy there are hundreds of thousands of stars, most of them are more old than our Sun, the Earth has four billion and a half years old.
Because on Earth, we could resist, in the species, intelligent, incredibly more old than ours, incredibly more advanced from the technological point of view, with millions of years of advantages, maybe they would be already traveling between the stars.
But we've never been contacted by any of these intelligent hypotheses, and here the question of fertile, I mean, where all of us are: it's something that can create some curiosity can unfold and, in fact, in the course of the years, have been tried many approaches to answer to this question, very fantastic proposals, but the simplest is that there is no one out there is no one out there, that we are alone.
So, it's possible, I believe that this is a question that we've asked us all how many, first or later, in life, I, at least, do it forever, when I was a child, I looked at a stell sky.
I asked myself if, around those luminous dots, it could be part of the planets, on those planets of living beings, that maybe at that moment, were looking at my direction if they were asking the same question, we were alone in the universe.
In our species, four centuries ago, Copernicana Revolution has told us that we are not physically at the center of the universe, a century and a half ago Charles Darwin has explained to us with all the other species of the planet, and in fact we come from a single paragonable, and maybe even better, to other two.
This is one of the great novels of the astrophysics of the last 20 years, 20 years ago, we could not really suspect it, that there were many passengers, so we still don't have a atmosphere, so to understand if, indeed, there are hundreds of plenty of plans that could be, for example, if we are, for example, in a response, we don't know it, but we are, in the last few years, we can also be many of them.
And the answer is not to prepare the allies, no, because they're incredibly far away, they're separated from us from an ocean of space, the universe is really very big, and then I give you an example, a concrete example: this peaceful probe, 60,000 kilometers from now, 17,000 km away from our next year, because I really believe that it would be a huge change for all of us.
It's a long time that any human civility is existed on our planet: we could do better, in the future, of course, we could do better, but also the light that travels to the mass speed designed in nature.
According to me, there's one of the things to have present when it's trying to give this path, and so it's very complicated, maybe we're not only in the universe, but we're surely similar to the question of female, and then the question we all have, where we're all of us, and the fact of having present is time.
And then, these microorganisms dominate life on Earth for a long time are replicated and differentiated thanks to natural selection, evolution, and only here.
The pulse of the right hand is the explosion of multcellular organisms, the most complex facts of a network of thousands of cells, the animals, the plants, the dinosaurs, appear here, at the end of the palm of the right hand.
(Laughter)
At the beginning of the last speaker, a natural event, catastrophic, very likely, throughout this long history of life on Earth, even if it's calculated that 99% of the species has never lived on this planet are extinct.
So this gives us an idea of the fact that this long story, the path of the evolution of life on Earth, was a long-term path, and that didn't have to bring to the origin of the most complex organisms, and less than ever had to bring to our species: Homo Sapiens, that's how we are in all this, where we are.
Great.
All the history of humanity?
It's in the tip of a wave.
We could completely can change the path with a lime.
And this has already happened, because today we know that for dozens of thousands of years on our planet have lived with us other human species that are no longer like Neanderthal.
So here, maybe, there's a bit the key to everything.
One day, as I hope, we will discover that there's another life in the universe, it's very likely that it will be microorganisms.
The first extraterrestrials could be simple bacteria, the fat could be dominated by microbes.
And intelligent species could be very rarely, and even their existence could be great, but sometimes a certain technological progress to self-advantaged, or, simply, impose, disappear, without letting them be brief, attractive, regarding the times of life.
The great cosmic silence that uncertainty encourages us, maybe a little, a kind of advertisement, maybe it's telling us something, the life has to overcome.
A great number of barriers to get to where we are today, but the biggest barrier we can have in front of us, in the future, after all, we think of ourselves, our species from far away, imagine us from another planet, if we disappear.
In other words, in the universe, no one would ever realize that we were.
We are a very young species, from just a century we started to fly, to communicate the radio, from a hundreds of years, we send waves in space, we arrived to the confinements of the Solar System, but we just put the tip of the foot in this big ocean of the cosmos.
What surrounds us?
I think that getting here is really a bit a bit like a peculiar, and we also have, as I believe, and hope, the possibility to use scientific knowledge and technology to face the problems we'll have in front of us, to guarantee a long future, even to reach other stars.
If there are super-integrated intelligences, as you can see in science movies.
So, the only hope to be part of the club, of these galaxies, is to survive the longest possible, we have hard, and if we were alone in all this space.
Well, then I believe that even more we have.
The duty to maintain access so that we can use this wonderful weakness, part of the case, in a small planet, lost in the bubble of the cosmos, thank you.
The story I want to talk about today is a story of sport.
But not the sport made of victory.
It's not the sport made by those who arrived before classified, but the sport made and that generates positivity and positive things for others, a sport that probably...
Then you'll like you to give us the strength to move forward, the strength to believe.
I'm here, in this photo, I'm running, yes, because I run, I like to run, and here I was in Namibia, during the first stage of a long trip.
A trip made of 104 kilometers, which later became 100 seeds, including two, because 154 of us were not too few, no, in addition to two, because it's a number that will return, in more times, this story.
And here I am, at the end of these 1600 kilometers, with everyone.
The trip and the difficulty started, immediately, from the first days, we were at the end of the map, and after six hours of trip, it was enough, difficult, we arrived in the desert of mine, the most old desert of the world, beautiful desert, a desert with particular characteristics that I chose for this kind of guys.
And here another casuality, the petoral, the petoral that was taught to me, the number "yes" still, this "yes" that makes me is an important number, it's an important number for me.
(Audience) Yes!
This is the first stage, it's the first stage in our mind, but the desert is in general, and the race is a bit like the metaphor of life: no, you start doing things, then, during life, the imprevists happen, but if you want to finish a challenge, a garage, there's always the possibility to react, and I have the first difficulty after three kilometers.
(Video) (English) What a beautiful sun!
(Making drum-like sounds) (Making sounds using the lid) Would you like that?
(Laughter) Well, I did things together, but I already do it... (Laughter) Thank you all, I've already supported it, I've never done it.
In fact, I couldn't move, because in this area I was associated with an important initiative of Foundarisinga, an important initiative to pick up funds for the control fight, in a infant tumour that, unfortunately, affects many children, I first of this experience, I didn't know many of these children, and when I was doing these 100 kilometers, I was collecting funds.
And there I learned many things: from a young man who guided a bus on a pull, and he also taught me that, in a certain point in the middle of the desert, a series that lasted for the second stage, that I had different problems, not the arms, of a humidity that we had, but, unfortunately, a lot of kids, for being happy, they had to have a cell phone.
The desert of Namibia is the desert I've chosen because, inside the Namibi's desert, there's no doubt, and probably only for the savings, and it's just to be happy, of many other things, but it's also important to valuate well how we're fortunate, but only six kilometers.
We're already at the kilometer 100 that also corresponds to the highest area of the world here in Namibia and the sky did it, now, the last four kilometers, and I'm happy, sorry, thanks to everyone who's wearing strength.
(Video) (English) (English) I love you, I don't understand anymore.
And I, in the desert, found - even when this morning, if I spoke about the small Prince of my pocket, and I found many people who, with me, have shared, if not other 26 people, because they were a very happy woman, 96 - 96 people who have been running with me, and at the end, have become a magic, an amazing magic.
As you can see, they were all very agile, I also had the part because the rooms were a bit rigid.
So these are us because the organization that what had made a km away from the arrival had put that flag to give me the chance to get to the official area and then go back to do another kilometer to return back to 1006.
Why did the project have the goal, I mean, to get to these?
(End of video) The collection is finished and gathered its goal: the 20th December 2016 that if you take the numbers are exactly the numbers that make 16 kilometers, or 200 for two, 200 dolls.
But I wasn't like that, I wasn't like that, so I didn't have hope for all, I didn't worry, you can also run like that, maybe a little more, I had 40 kg in more.
I wasn't very sportsive, I smoked.
I was sometimes captained to the people to smoke, and surely I was 100 meters and I was already doing this.
I wasn't just sorry.
In addition, beyond having a wife that's enough, I had two children, one of the biggest one, Riccardo, who's already been there for six years, and the other feet, who was six years old, and, obviously, had already understood, it's the situation.
It's a bit like the race.
This celebral hemorrhage, which I mentioned before, at the end of the fact, sometimes you have to know how to act, unfortunately Pietro had a celebral hemorrhage, which we didn't know, during the birth, and it has lowered naturally, and this is the last time they saw it smiling.
And what does it mean?
So, what do we do?
But when did it look like?
When it seemed that everything went well, February 18.
In 2010, unfortunately, they called us and had an infarction because it was too broken, OK?
AC: The woman was called Ranna, 116 Pitro, you've understood the number 6.
(Audience) And then ...
And of course not.
KA: I don't have it.
I don't want to give a broken impression, but in these moments?
You don't need to beaten.
It's my illusion.
(Applause) But I have to continue to keep going forward in life and give the possibility to the other two that have arrived: I've got to Emma and I've arrived at 29, June in San Pietro.
And so I started running, the first image you see on the screen is my first marathon, inside the RNA of Milan, and then a year later, at the end of the desert of the Namibia, where I had to do what to get to pick up the money, which is always the doctor, so there are two or two, because I didn't only have the water inside the desert.
Anyway, the difficulties we can have.
Great or small ones that are there, there's always a hope for everyone to do a lot of things and to move forward.
(Applause) Today we're here.
And today it's 176.
From 2017.
Three times, you know, you can see how you want to interpret it, thanks to all.
