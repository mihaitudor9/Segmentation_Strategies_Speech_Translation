In 2016, I was given a award: from the National Forum Forticing Learning, supported by the Ministry of the United States in Irlanda, from the name a little particular, they were born in Church.
KA: The motivation of this award was my availability in the confrontation of the students and my ability to create data environments.
Less formal, more relaxing, let's imagine that this is.
A big university class.
So, usually, I go to class.
The first ten minutes, when the students enter and get there.
I put my computer to explain and put a classic music.
I think this is the first step to create data environments, less forming the most reassuring, and try to maintain the attention of the students.
Unfortunately, it's not always easy.
(Laughter) During my lessons, I use a method used at the end of the old age.
Storietelling.
The pedagogical level, the storytelling is a method based on the use of narratives to transmit knowledge to students.
And just with this moment I'd like to start my lesson, explaining to you, describing you a topic about the mouth of everyone, already.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that children tell, I'd like to start my story.
There was once.
Second World War.
1942.
It's a nest.
Blockchain Park.
A ...
Resilience in northern London.
There was a young, 30 years old.
Alan Turing.
Let's see here in Cambridge's school.
And they get a research doctor in logic, at the Princeton University, in America.
In that time, the Tedes used a machine.
Special.
It's enigma.
It was like a writing machine.
The operator digitalized details, but old that stuck on a paper.
The texts used this mechanism to communicate between them.
But anyone would interceive this paper in front of you without any sense.
It was shouting.
Alan Turing.
It was one.
One of the main figures in Blockchain Park.
With his team.
And I built them a machine.
The one you can see.
In other words, in order to decipher.
This test is written by the Tedesque.
For this invention, we think that war is finished with two years of anticipation.
It's taking many human quickly.
In the adventure, continuously, after the war, to do its logical research.
And it's considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
With your Turing machine?
And he formalizes the concept of computer, even before the computer was created in practice.
In 1950, an article published on the "Mind magazine."
"Computing machine learning."
Where does the test come from?
The question behind the testing is a very precise one.
They can think.
From here, artificial intelligence began.
Probably many of you have seen the movie of Emitation Game, the game of limitation, I want to explain to you.
Let's suppose there's a person here?
It's digital to the computer.
That asks questions, and on the other hand, a machine M.
It's an operator.
In an alternative way, the machine M and the opponent O.
They provide the answers to the person.
(Laughter) It's said that the machine is overwhelmed if the person is not able to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the operator.
This is limiting a game.
The machine must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
You must interpret the natural language.
The question that comes from the person.
It must represent knowledge to form the answers.
We must think in an automatic way to form these answers.
And it must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence.
One of these is the cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this process, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to capture thinking.
In the moment they are born.
Or we try to modify the thinking at a psychological level.
That's why artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive neural sciences and psychology.
According to this approach, the assunction that if we can really have a female representation of human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of the laws of rational thinking.
Probably many of you.
They've heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man.
All the men are mortal.
Socrates are mortal.
This is a deductive argument.
Take two premises.
Let's see.
It's dedicated to a true conclusion: from here the logic is born, according to the approach of thinking laws.
We try to build educational arguments.
And to see them in a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational agents.
A rational agent?
An entity.
(Laughter) It must act.
It must be adapted to the context.
It must take them goals, and know how to take them to end.
And it must act in a rational way.
So TestD Turing is linked to intelligent people, reformulating the Turing phrase, a machine to think.
We can say, "Can we create a machine?"
An artificial agent.
I'm able to think.
To exhibit intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence, so it's at the purpose of creating artificial entities, intelligent, your phone and an entity.
Among the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence as psychological construct.
Once we have more knowledge.
What about this?
What's the thing?
It's close to build entities.
Artificial intelligence is supported by humans.
It's a cycle.
Thank you.
But let's see today.
If machines can think.
I'd like to explain to you to describe the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I'd like to use.
Five classes to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We have subtle agents.
Stop human beings.
Sovereignity.
Superhuman.
Finally, we have optimal agents.
I want to explain to you with some examples: optimal agents are those who act better than all men and can't do better.
For example, people who used the cube of Rubik play with a four-year-old strength in the best way, play a sad, think that a few years ago a young man has rescued.
It was the beginning of the Rubik cube, it has resulted it in 4.73 seconds.
A few months ago, they created an agent, a robot that was able to solve in zero,63 seconds.
We have the sovereign agents.
They act better than all people.
For example, it's a game of the rocks.
In the game of the scary.
A few years ago, the championship ...
Russian, diskissing, sponsorship, knocked from a artificial agent.
We have urgent people about humans.
Those who manage almost like all people, for example, in the Power Texan game.
I'll answer the question of the kitchen.
We need to stop the mind.
Who do they act?
Almost like all people.
For example.
In cognitive activities, like the crowned words.
Or the image classification?
Finally, we have subtle people who manage the worst of all people.
Exemples are the classification of objects.
The recognition of caligraphy, the vocal recognition, the translation of a language to the other.
But if there's something that artificial agents, today, are not able to do, for example, is disambiguation.
We're talking about the result.
How?
The mum!
Are we talking about it?
It's the Mark of Apple Corporation.
It's something that people are not able to do, it's the region in the ideal world, in uncertainty situations.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence, so you think we are far from overcoming the test.
But let's see now in the future.
They will be able to think.
A few years ago.
In America, a thing was introduced by the name of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest ones.
Experts of artificial intelligence in the world.
Imagine the time line.
Imagine a line.
What indicates the human intelligence ascending?
Now imagine a red line that indicates the machine intelligence with an exponential environment.
This is a blind moment.
Landing.
I've predicted in the wall laws, so ...
The computer complexity, for example, measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, radiated in the two years and in four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to...
It's the use of this computer complexity to simulate the human brain.
I don't need it.
In 2020 we would have access to 1,000 dolls to this computer capacity.
In 2025, secondary and crossed, I'll never be able to get rid of our brain in a precise way.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will spend the test, they will overcome the test.
And then?
In 2045 and India, the moment in which technology singularity will have.
In which machines will follow the intelligence of the machines and follow an exponential environment that will radically change.
Human intelligence.
In his article.
It's published on the mind magazine.
The tourists don't only proposed their test, but they also propose new objections against their own test.
These objections are us against artificial intelligence.
Any year ago?
I was a student at the University of Varese, followed a path of episode, of ethicalontology, of computer science, had such a Gaithan teacher in Aur√©lio Lanzerone.
Unfortunately, a few years ago, one of the compounds we had to move was to propose a decade of obedience.
With the test of Turing, with artificial intelligence, I was the only one that proposed a decade formulated, mathematical communication.
OK, what's human stupidity?
But I want to describe it in simple terminals: let's suppose to take the intelligence of all people to put the seed.
It's the symbol of summers at the minister of equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
So we got it.
An intelligence equality, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were us?
To transfer our intelligence inside a machine.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we left the machine become more intelligent than us.
So to conclude my story.
Let's ask myself to the initial question.
They can think about them.
I'd like to leave you.
With an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
But how many of you today have taken pictures?
Thank you.
Okay, this gives me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in the bathroom, and it serves everyone, I'm the creative director of a study that takes care of photography, and I've spent the last three years.
This is me, immersed among my maps, to take care of a liquid matter: the photography, which is the product and broadcast through the cell phone.
Her limits, her contradictions, her potentialities, her impact on the market, her projectual and self-esteem, but there are many others, in which way the photographer changes the processes through which we communicate.
We can consider the photographer a new language, in order to influence theesthetics of the vision that forms of communication, the technical consciousness there is.
In the production of a scenario, from a professional photographer, there's still the difference regarding the simple gesture of primary and pulsing on a smartphone.
And how does photography change the forms and the structure of professional photography to find answers to these questions?
With pictures, rescuers, criticisms, theories that deserve the photographer had the way to elaborate experiences and reflections.
The professional photographers, instead, that for the first ten years, have embraced the challenge of this new means, I asked them to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the successes, of their images, through the cell phone.
To find answers, I looked around me.
And I arrived in New York.
At the DSC of the photo editor of New York Times Magazing, in Cathy Ryan.
Is it Berlin?
In the AIM sede, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock.
In Parigi.
In the "Parifotto" room, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world.
To enter those places where photography is distributed, it's based on contents, and understand how the photographer changes these engratulations.
To find answers, I tried to look beyond.
In addition to the surface of the great common places, the visits of the contemporary.
For example, the selfie.
The selfie is to get involved, simply, to an artistic delirium correlated, like some sociologists have written with the occupational bass of the generation of the millennials, or can't be seen as a health of segments.
Like an identical stadium, like a overwhelming reappropriation of their own image, as it's joyfully reivindicated by visual artists, as "Ketard Ben".
Take a slow look.
The phyto-pintage aesthetics that has signed and still segregates our mobile vision.
This is my dog, Zazi, a victim designed by my photographic experiments, and it's simply the result of a world's world's world's worldwide.
Or, instead, as the social sociologist was born in New Yorkson, it can't be read to the most complex factors of social and historical nature, even economical.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of answers, it's the territory of interpretations.
And from this phenomenon, I tried to give an interpretation in a book.
It's called "Revolution," I mean, for a story of the photographer, because in front of the excessant flow of images we are exposed, it seemed to me useful to try to draw a map, if not to find the route, at least to understand what we are.
And how are we?
The story of Mobile photography is short, but in a few years I've invented millions and millions of people.
A new code that exceeds every linguistic barrier, used daily to communicate, testify themselves, to feed a constant flow of images that put in communication the individuals of an angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collective world, if you want, that has impressive numbers.
Every two minutes, today, we climb more images of how many Americans have taken in the burden of the year 20th century.
More than 350 million of these images are carried every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production, the diffusion of images, of activities that, until a few years ago, looked at a right search for professionals.
It became an instinct of action of our daily experience.
A form of social interaction.
A channel of proof of our private sphere in public dimension.
In which we define ourselves through the images we produce.
Or better.
We exist because we produce images.
And if the photographer is a new language, then it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that is still strongly signed by that process of self-esteem.
Of the certainties, that's how brilliantly individualed by the Zygmunt Poundman philosophy.
It's as a typical of a modernity, where structures, work, family, coppy are always easier, and here actors are unstable points in a universe in movement, sponsored in front of the media of the messages that affect them daily.
The flow of the photographer looks like the form of more natural expression.
A liquid vision that is composed of compounds.
It's constantly based on the instant gratification of our sharing need.
But in a world where each one, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone.
What's the professional photographer?
And what difference does it happen between accidental and conscious photographs?
On the one hand, the facility of using the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing professionals the universal language.
Fortunately, with the process of democratization of photography.
I started with Lera Kodak and arrived until the iPhone.
On the other hand.
The use of cell phone as a reward tool offered to professional photographers.
Nine possibilities in approach to stories, the contents, the subjects.
Now, on one hand.
The opening to everyone, to all of us, of a dialogue channel, with a potentially global audience, has moved the professional photographer of their exclusive void.
Like a producer of images.
It has put them in crisis the social function, the economic position.
It's enough to think of the rule that had the photographer and social network in the first Arab Spring.
Difference to be.
A powerful tool to orient public opinion is a capture of machines and information, difficultly controlled by the regimes: this is an image of dogs, a show that the museum "Folfang" has dedicated to the rule of the photographer Mobile in the first Arab.
But on the other hand.
Let's think that the possibility of direct interaction through the web, through Instagram, between the photographer and the audience, has liberated the photographer from the obliged passage.
For the hands of the editor, the liberated by the need to undertake a political agenda, a editorial line detected by others, and not always based on journalistic priorities, I've liberated it from the impossibility to reach the destinations of their own message, if it has not through traditional channels, like sexy resources.
And he allowed them to put themselves directly in the user's shoes, traveling.
Would you keep visits in real time, an interesting example?
The offer is the magazine Time, in 2012, with the cover, it's Instagram and it's directly posted in real time through the T-Cober's mechanism, its own images, deligning a new model of New Smaking and visualism, the reality in journalism.
This is the macket of the book that has had originated after this experiment, and if in the X-rays, a Instagram photographer based on a American photography, Research, Courniz, and dedicated to the conservation of the universal heritage of the photography of the photography and society in 19900.
Or they are born names.
Nine paths of curatory selection, like 14-1500 Bilfotographers, a international shipwreck for self-related and distributed photographers through iPhone, created by two professional photographers in North America around a topic.
But then are the photographs that in the last years have operated this tool with a great authority awareness?
I'm photos like Michael Cristophe Brown.
Let's take it.
Orona Vib, who have used and use the smartphone of conflicts, showing how the agility and the description of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of deepness.
Photography, Metero Coyaama, who, from a simple smartphone, has explored new paths for Newsmaking, creating a well-being platform to put in touch the American soldiers in the south of Afghanistan with their families and create a motor of information from the front of the first hand.
(Video) Bread Manging, who is used for sports photography, exclusive territory of photographers with hyper-performant appearances, and made a vehicle of intimate narration in the middle of the country.
Richarch Corte Ernandt, who enjoyed the description and manner for the photographer, creating a very personalistic aesthetics.
I'll tell you that he made a small report, going back to the American community of Brooklyn, and creating a community waiting for the parts around his job.
It's a goal that uses it daily to build its family album, by putting a reflection on how Instagram changes the facts of our privacy, and the way we build and preserve our visual memory.
Peter of Campo, who, through the African Country, has shown how the photographer, far from limiting simply to generate visual cliches, could also be used to discuss the Western stereotypes on the crisis and the famine.
As they know about Luigi, who has reinterpreted the Omer's history with the cell phone, telling in the AI series of ones of the oldest heritage of the West, with the new vision tool.
Or as I've been born in Lourlin, who has photographed the manifesting smooths in Piazza, who, during the protests of Mai-Tan, with a beautiful poetry, and contemporary scholarship.
Well, what do these photographs know how to do?
To tell, going to the outskirts of action, or looking for personalized tags on the event, to avoid more than recording.
Creating images that are never straightened to reality, but that are born from a deep interaction between photographer and content to be broadcast on different platforms and reach different audiences.
To make network using the connections in an innovative way.
Putting on the author's exercise for its point of view on the world.
And on the quality of depth.
Because anyway, it's the tool that is represented.
Only if the conceptuality of photography is smiled by a lonely, articulated in a powerful way.
It can distinguish themselves.
From the visible rumor of the bottom that offers us.
All of this, I believe.
It's still the difference between a photograph that is: it's the reward of the real, its bullying, reproduction, its reference and sharing.
And a photograph that, in reality, can still be a cultural metaphor.
Thank you.
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
What we believe is silence.
Actually, there are 50 "erts" of electric race.
There are 50-hourds that are immediately entered.
In our lives.
We wake up from the illusion that silence exists.
A email.
There is no.
So also in this room, those providers.
These seeds.
And put a 50-hert frequency, then you imagine yourself, you go home after a work day, really stressful.
You eat, with your partner, with your partner, and then you'll get into the bubble of your bed camera and think you're alone.
But no.
There's always her.
This frequency of 50 Hers.
Because I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible, in our cases, in our lives, but it's more or less this sound.
We have a positive aspect.
Or better, first of the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist, but we have a positive aspect.
We are never alone, that is, always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Very good.
It's harmful.
And if we look at it as a drawing, this frequency of 50 Ears is nothing more than a sound wave, a wave with a beautiful rich spectrum, with which we can make music, and then I asked myself, "But why?
Why not make us music?
So, I'm a composer of sound colonies, an artist, I'm now a little special, because I'm complicated life deciding to make music alone and exclusively through rumor.
And my parents?
They were divorcing when I was a child.
"Yes."
I know, you think this is the classic story in Strappa Lacre, but it was the revelation of my life.
Because in loneliness.
From those days, in the weight of the void of that house, I started to make music with everything I surrounded you, so ...
Each income complement was no longer.
A classic complement of network, we fermed, immobile, before the voice.
But it becomes my musical tool.
With a joy among the other of my mom, who every roof didn't find the bikes, among the other man, Macciao, was looking at me from the streaming, which is a great freedom.
Of course, I say, at some point...
But you're going to become a normal person, I try to say.
I tried because I started studying Chitarra.
It's a strong piano.
Then I liked Woody Allen, right?
So I started to create the grandson, the problem I really liked Arenzo Arvor, who wrote a beautiful song in Bigoa, was coming like the first years of study in Genova.
I also dropped the clarine.
Well, that's how, to not go ...
It's easy to illusion my classmates.
But why did I abandon all this, why did I study and escape from that notation so rigid?
Because there's more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more sponsors in a rumor.
And I like to paragonate it.
To the problems of life.
All of us have attacked them.
A rumor, a failure, something that made us think, but I'm sure that that that that rumor made us grow much more.
And a smile.
So, what is my mission?
After when I'm a child, it's about transforming a failure, a rumor.
In Music.
It's to harmonize everything that is.
It's around me.
I'm going to make a beautiful turning point.
And everything would be concluded, but no, I was complicated in this way life.
What is it?
The sound.
But above all!
What is the study?
So, the study is one of the most difficult senses to understand, but also the most immediate, the most powerful.
To transmit an emotion.
Our internal eye, the protein of the oceans, our team, reaches the maximum functionality around the fifth week of gesture.
I say, "Twenty weeks of gesture," this means that we started to listen, even before talking, we started to listen even before seeing.
And this is not a case.
Because the fact must be ready.
I know that the sponsor in life, once born, must be ready to the Nora texture.
It shouldn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So, in a case, if the mother, during the pregnancy, listened to Pancroco British, didn't get stupid if the child once was born.
"Yes."
It will end up listening, for example, Sex Pistols.
Food, moms, I'll give you, and it's a richness that I personally make you attention to the musical choice: wait for the trap, more than another ... OK!
But what is sound?
The sound is that.
It's all that we're surrounded, and sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what, in our lives, is completely abstract.
You don't see, you don't touch.
Like the sound colony of every day, the rhythm in our partner, the mother who screams us, because the mother writes us, still, always.
All of this is the sound colony of our days.
"Yes."
Of course, the visual is much easier.
We don't know.
The visual is when we enter the system's hair, we say.
It's smaller than how I imagined them.
More small, what?
It's a small man of Milan.
The smaller than San Pietro.
A housewife, maybe?
It's understood the same as when a person sees me in video, or on stage, and then I tell you about people, and they tell me.
I imagined higher, of course, even because it's lower, it would be really impossible.
So?
Going from this presentation.
Is it visible?
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's go!
To imagine our lives, I would like to genuine your ability to observe, so we are in vacation.
We're in the sea, not in case, and we start.
I have a soccer blog, who talks about soccer, kilometers, kilometers, kilometers, I'm not in Europe, but it's also a lot of food, because I have to take a lot of photos, well, I'm a soccer blog, it's not true.
"I'm crazy, huh!"
No one eating doll.
We photograph it.
We look at it.
Let's take many videos.
But we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I teach you a trick: when do you get it with someone?
The best moment to know the person is to stay in silence, that silence that, among the other, doesn't exist: go for two.
To listen.
Let's stop?
And to listen.
Like in this moment.
So, today I'd like to take you with me, I'd like to bring you with me.
It turns around the world, it was evolving.
Your perception of listening.
And I'd like to start by telling you.
The dream of my life, the dream of my life that is born.
From alcohol?
It's the last one.
For the first time, I listened to myself, it was 2013, I wanted to run away from the History, a series of failures, problems and others.
Because then they turned into harmony, but I think I'm going to look for a very far place in Italy.
So, I decided to choose.
A city on the Atlantic.
There was the Atlantis, yes, it's true.
There was still a lot, there was one of the largest cities, culturally.
Artistically, and really far from me.
Shanghai decided to participate in a competition, I came to an artistic residence and started the most beautiful years of my life, for the simple fact that for the first time I was listening to myself.
So, I didn't have money, I had so much fear: I had an idea, but I was the only one to believe us, and it was the one that would have listened to the sounds of the whole world, of all the cities of the world, creating this project "Sound of City."
And the whole part, really, from the sound of the cities, the cities are a great musical tool to wake up this musical tool, you can enter the last of the cities.
I'd like to take you to this moment to Shanghai, where?
For 48 hours, I'm not registered his purposes of the city.
And I created a sound colony.
So, at this moment?
I want to sound.
Shanghai.
You were still focused on the visual, and this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say that it's a test, it's all collected to the visual.
That's it.
There's a city that's sure, you've photographed in every way, and you've asked yourself more than once, but that smoke that comes from the tombs that are done.
But the bridge of Brooklyn can sound.
The bridge of Brookly is an executional.
Everything completely online.
And I want to add it to the other.
Or the Counter, who is really touched on the side, is something very important to say.
Hello.
Beautiful, but it's not beautiful because it's on the other side of the world.
It's not magical because it's on the other hand.
It's magical because under our eyes every day.
Maybe many of you...
They know a pair of places.
In this picture?
The sound rule is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, going around a city, losing yourself in the same city, well, I knew Genova.
I knew Genova because there were many times, there were absolutely captured many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that between my favorite cities, now, scaven the applause, I prepare you.
(Applause) I started to record the first sounds.
And the first sounds were given to these children, in this tube.
Difference, anthropic, gave me this audio camp.
And I'll make you feel, before the Greek camp, and then the one to work.
But now, what's the lab?
That's not it.
I left to the aircraft.
(Audience talking) Great.
And I like a poem, I'm part of the fact that...
So normal, I've never been, I've attacked this beautiful man, and it has restricted me a very low frequency that has become a synthesiser.
It's a reaction.
I'm in the lab.
Of course, Genova is "Morzandis" (Laughter) and it wasn't a battle, this is a serious thing.
Let's give the world.
The writing.
That you see constantly in the pity of Ferrari, it's not just a writer, for me it's a great musical tool, and it helped me to support the bit of this colony.
It's more or less like that.
The last sound, after I really want to sound new, is that of...
All the doors of the port.
That we are used to look at, but the sound is a perception that is opposed to the view, and so I created this microphone.
"No."
In March, for 48 hours.
In Genova's port, I found a sound of a track that gave me a particular frequency that became the melody, and when it became the melody, it's because putting it in the loop is transformed into what it is.
The voice of the colony is no.
This is its rock and roll.
It's true.
Now, I wanted to make you feel a genius, go wrong.
This point came to me.
Here's Genova as a sound.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
I spend the sound of our passions, in my and your own, and for how many people will tell you they're rumorous, stuck.
Time went by, you really want to listen to it, and I invite you to listen, thank you!
As it's said Guybek in Italian, but generally used restitution, it's not perfect, but it's not the idea, in general, the idea of restitution linked to monetary institution to beneficence, many times, instead, the restitution is linked to restricting what you've done, what you've learned.
And passing from those who say, doesn't work.
After that, in Italy it doesn't work at all in this country, we try it, so the next 18 minutes I'll share a few examples of this story, going from the end of the '90s, precisely, this is my son's exercise.
At the end of the sixth grade, in the same year, my monkey organized the funds to pay the material.
From the asilo.
It was an activity.
Very heavy, made with many parents.
But some of them said, "No, why should we help, we must think about the common state?"
Most of them were extraordinary efforts.
To help the asylum to help the community.
It has collected a million 200,000 readers, because they don't remember 600 euros, and it was one of the efforts of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later, we take the United States, this is now.
It's similar: the same scenario for a nearby school, this is the biggest child.
And there's a completely different reality, which was extraordinary for us, we realize that it's a totally ordinary reality.
There's the issue of the game Beck, of the restitution.
It's normal.
So the extraordinary effort of an Italian genital is ordinary for all that society.
Not that the American society is perfect.
So much.
I said, "This is the thing of restitution, I've had fortune, I rest, I help the school."
There are also the mechanisms, there was fishing lucidity, there were universities, the museum has helped the the theater, there are all the communities, financially, of volunteer restitution, it doesn't work, it's based on this.
I'm ten years old, some of you may have known it, this is the south's launch.
It has supported the famous Obama Ker.
Sit that says, "System is the moment."
Trump is trying us a lot.
But actively, if you ask me, "System is one of the moment."
Obama is the famous bank, and there was an incredible technological debate.
The technological launch has spilled 100 million dolls, so not worried about these things didn't happen only in Italy: they build a sid that doesn't work.
There are so many million contacts, and this is the standard answer they got.
(Laughter) In short, it's not finishing for a few days, but then some stop criticizing, it's enough to do, to criticize, which is easy and normal to try to do and help, which is difficult, extraordinary.
Of us, it's not something common.
This is Time Magazine's coverage.
Refigure the experts of technologies sent by Google and other companies, they were offered, and I agree with the Bianca house, I didn't have the kitchen, I put it in the session, I stayed in a few weeks, in a decade of the costs.
After all, many would have criticized, but I'm surely interested in this.
What about it?
The extraordinary effort, and not the ordinary, I've seen that I've finished in the TAMEGS, it's very interesting.
I want to explain what was spinning, I'm spinning by people, not yet.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this validity, this bag, and they decided to reproduce the experiences that had filled their lives.
In this case?
They look at the ability to manage big technological systems, unbearable processes.
Repetible.
And make them, at the same time, unbearable and unbearable.
It's creating a replicable system, which is the USA, from this effort, then was born.
A system replicates what we hope to do with us.
Thank you.
I want to talk about the word model.
Because one also implies the models, which were the help of our lives that inspired us and taught us.
Well, those who taught you perseverance, the desire to never move, to continue to insist, energy, empathy.
So these models are part of this bag that we need to use, we want to reproduce.
But for me, obviously, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also the factor of Italy.
Almost 30 years old from the History.
The idea of helping was also because I'm Italian.
I wanted to do it.
There's no way to find out.
To do or not do, there's no attempt, maybe it's in Italian, it's to do or not only to criticize.
A few years later, we're five to the San Francisco Mateorence and the Visica Avenue, to the Silicon Valley, to be aware of the necessary transformation in general.
Some things have stopped us a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of processes, for the digital transformation of the public administration, asks me why don't you come to help us for a couple of years?
I think about it, I think about my wife, Monica, and I talk to my genius genius to have the brief, I decided to apply a choice methodology, so I said, "Don't think I've never tried it."
The choice was made, and so it goes from the seat to the Rome for two years.
It's a matter of money.
- Ah, Amazon!
But those who have to do it, Mallia, Amazon, Probono, Maiday, something will give you underwater, these are only many phrases, I have to say that we've also received so much support, so at this moment we're focusing on this part, but in a positive part there was.
(Laughter) I was mentally preparing for skepticism and bureaucracy, people ask me, "But do you expect these little bubbles, and yes, I didn't expect it, of course?"
But the scientist must often have cinism that characterizes you a certain mentality.
You will never do it, of course, because you don't have the rights, I've heard a lot of this kind.
This country, in fact, lacks a lot the sense of common good.
And it's about doing things because you think of helping, to improve a situation not only because it's not interested.
And here's it: for the days of you, this is a commission.
For the most elderly, you recognize it, as an extraordinary commissioner, I say this because it's their rule that allowed me to be able to take people from the public administration.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is, since the systems from inside don't become, we want to try to transform them with people who come from outside, where the fact that they don't know the public administration is a asset, and they don't have a suitcase, it's a advantage and it's a new world.
Not big, but it's also too small: technological experts around 80% are expected to do legal judges.
Governative, communication.
Here you can see the post I had done when, by myself, I started this adventure, I said, "Why don't we write?
What I think will happen.
In this way, we want to attract talents, talents that you live in Italy, or that you want to come back.
Also temporary.
It has a compensation, and it's probably very good to do with what you see, how I'll convince you.
So I've put myself in the idea, but how do I convince someone to do the same thing I'm doing, for the other, maybe some of you recognize it, that photography of the mining of the beautiful, that in the '47s, all the United States, all the United States, in this massive sport, of investment and infrastructure?
We created the vision.
The operative system of the country is a series of fundamental components that can build simpler services, effective for citizens, public administration and companies, through innovative digital products.
The very beautiful vision of the invention is the blood and blood.
I've continued, in my place, the soccer field in Salita, the American soccer, I'm wrong.
And I continued, we will also have many rules, complicated, sometimes incomprehensible, it's a easy prediction: we must learn to manage with intelligence and bureaucracy, many will say, don't understand how public administration works.
They've already tried it in many, they've failed, in Italy it doesn't work like that.
And it continues.
We'll get many criticisms: some comments will be useful, others will be cinemas and prejudices.
In other words, the criticisms of the first type will make people who really want to offer their contribution and they've found them a lot.
The second type of color they want to defend the state of the school is that they always see the bubble in the middle of the void.
Or that, simplerly, the power is drawn.
And this is a big problem.
To teach things that don't work.
Remember this image: the first, men and women on the cover of Time Magazin.
Here's it.
So, despite looking for the most possible people to do with the eye, I received about three,000 questions.
So, certainly, at least a centimeter, decently qualified, we've used digital tours for the Colloqui, an app called Jazz, we have it in the middle of the government, we've done a mathematical website, a technological part, the team has reached the mass, and now we're a little more advanced, and it's immediately started to operate, what do we do?
In fact, we take care of Draulica.
These are the tubes of the public administration, some of them to do many to connect, because it's the big problem.
What is it?
The systems, the processes, the applications, anything that should be interconnected, is "asylos" and doesn't connect.
And I'm not only talking about the machine, I'm also talking about people who don't want to explore their own data, their own members, their own applications, so it's about introducing the thing, writing, explaining it.
And in years, to implement it, to connectivity, to interrupt.
And sponsor the code of the public administration.
So I can focus on the software, of course, and do so many projects activities.
So, so much hydraulic activity.
But we can't also be pictures.
To make the services of the beach, in time, you have to make them better, to make them better, to make them easier.
All these things are done in parallel, but without the tubes you can't do the PIB.
After a few months, in the midst of 2017 we wrote the piano "Trienna" by the Administration Transformation, we did together with the AGI of other people who helped us, what does something exist?
Two.
It's written in a clear, technological way.
But also in the process.
It was the first time.
It has saved and sponsorized from the government, the Trianal decrease, it requires a game of square to simplify the public administration, the life of the citizen, particularity of the piano.
It's been newspaper once a year, for those planes can't be static, especially in technology.
And it's appreciated to administrations.
What is this, this is the only way to make the pieces in Italy, in the public administration?
The regulation remains the technical rules, and you read exactly three pages of view and connections to other norms in other rules, and at some point the technological rules are quite uncomfortable: unfortunately we can't fly these things, but we can do it in parallel.
Other things: so the trendal piano is put on the githab, the technology of you understand it, and it's put on the way we can talk to the administrators, the feedback, the documentary on the rhythm, in a way that public administration and software can not exist.
To improve it.
We dedicate ourselves to this particular moment, and this is always a part of the piano.
There are the militant platforms, these are the digital platforms, they are those things that ability to ignore all the activities of the public administration, more there will be.
Digital payment is one: electronic cards, electronic letter, which is a habitant platform, the identity to digitalize a platform.
The major project we've followed is called the national and resilient population.
"Yes."
Let's put this.
Using technologically all the data of you, citizens, that at this moment are at 8,000 different sides, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, in the only Database, synchronous.
Where data is talked about them, especially synchronized, and they talk to the rest of apps of the administration: when I'm transferred to a common to the other, I have to.
First of all, what I was managing, manually, then I have to go to the school, to the motorization, to all those places, I have to say, all those things I've already had to know.
We're solving the technological solution, then we'll do so much about processes.
Two weeks ago, we made a series Akaton.
where 800 software educators have worked on those brilliant applications, they were used in 96 interventions.
Fixing, so, putting problems on software in a world.
A improvement of documentary, and even to new projects: all this leads - we're talking about sustainability and scalability in the sight of beautiful and spontaneous Italy, where they're exposed - all the documentary, and all the coders, but there's no Italian, but there are many Italians that are helping us from the technological point of view.
In the Italian publication, now there will be a fifth of what would be left, maybe even in the middle.
The future is today, we dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that, financially.
They don't limit themselves to make hydraulic, they also enter the boat.
But it serves that the paintings are completed, sorry, I insist, this can be, for example, and it's one of those things that would have.
Although we'll leave the alsa aviation, we're digital citizenship.
"Oh, the phone!"
Smartphone has the digital identity, has the data of electronic identity, has NPR.
It's already functional, and all this is the purpose of making it easier to familyize the interaction between the citizens and the public administration.
The interpretation is simple.
We're dreaming a little, because of work we'll really do so much, but it's different from this vision.
A few weeks ago, the storm.
It's been around 150 years since the world has written an uncertainty.
They expect us a lot of people.
I was asked to talk about what they think can happen, I was asked to talk about simplification of the lives of every day of the citizens.
I've taken the opportunity to write an article that I want to mention to you.
Some fish?
It's a desire or dream, maybe we do it.
We want a country where politicians who try to understand the digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rule and not the exception.
A country where they read recognize and promote the right to innovate, to embrace it.
A country where technological skills are also inside the state and public companies.
A country where there are more public companies and private, guided by 30 years than 70.
Imagine, in the end, a country where working for public administration is a north, where better brains make money to work in public research centers, which are green and precisely the centers of excellence and innovation.
The door doesn't develop the country.
That's how a dream is.
And what are the components to do all this, process politicians?
Technological digitals are really many and maybe too many.
But if it's not a dream about which points are difficult, they can do things.
First to conclude.
This is my mom who belonged to the people who told me, "Who did you do it?"
(Laughter)
(Audience) Yes!
But here it serves somewhere in this theater, at this point, it's more calm, and I've managed to explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the digital Tinder, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
And if you want information about us, our site is our social, thank you.
Did you know the possibility to make a desire?
One only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't go as you'd like.
What would you change?
And what would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your genius, your employees?
You're afraid, you're looking at you, you're going to see that "yes" because here behind I know there's - then raise your hand those who would change their own body, maybe lose some kilos, or maybe win them in muscles.
Ah, here there's a little more freedom, raise your hand those who wouldn't have taken all of you, or maybe you're the ones who would change partner.
(Audience talking) Yes!
But more times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
Let's not understand if you'll change the part, and the answer would be because the elementary ones would have a more united family, but the doctors weren't separated.
Thank you very much.
In the media, I would have wanted to be better, for the pleasure of the youths.
At Liceo, I wanted to feel the most complicated teachers, they seemed to me all the hostiles, and I reflected in music, here the great void to make in the living room.
I went to the university, I wanted to work, but I found myself with the difficulty of access to the work market, so all the first part of my life I had to fight and fight to try to understand how to change the things that didn't go well, from what others thought about me, to the great economical hands, from interpersonal relationships, to my characteristics and my acquired until the birth.
And then I became a psychologist.
However, I looked at my research to other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
But these strategies, if they used in a small dose, could also take some benefits, but if, as most cases happen, were the only three maps to play in front of a crisis, they couldn't solve anything good, but they ended up maintaining their problem.
(Applause)
The strategy, today, is more diffused.
(Laughter) It's lamenting, we know many people who fall in the bottom of the window, and the problem is that if it's a mental space, this paralyzes you, it's not a bit of everything, there's crisis, there's no work that's traffic, that's cold, that I'll do it in a different way, we lie to the spot.
I remember a girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything else than to get rid of, who left her, then from the girl with whom he had never helped her, felt a true ability, and here was the mind that she had completely colonized her daily life.
So, unfortunately, for all of us, it's a bit the great attempt.
Because with a small effort.
You can get a great result.
To review the rule of the victim, that was listened, comfortable, helped.
But beat well.
Can you lament the night or day?
Only or with friends, in high voice or in your mind?
And you can lament yourself of something that has already happened, or something that maybe one of you could happen.
You can lament yourself at the roof, or as much more often happens, you can lament yourself right.
Because we all have many reasons to be able to grow.
But the truth is that for how much you will make you hardly remember something around you will change, elderly, you won't do anything else than giving more attention to what makes you say.
If the strategy that privileges, when things don't go as you want, is to slow down, presume that someone is at the study of a B piano to save the leg.
Imbocate.
(Laughter) Another very objective strategy, when things are stretched, is to impose our need.
(Laughter) At the base of this mentality, there's a growing cultural fact that we learned that if something doesn't work well, it's enough to change it, we can manipulate our pleasure, what surrounds us.
Don't you like the shadow?
But from the aesthetic circle?
(Laughter) You feel a little further, but why never be in the suffering?
We take two pillars and we solve it easy.
His wife breaks, divorce.
At the fresh, we all agree how many risks to the palm.
"My son doesn't listen to you, Menalo."
It's too big to not register it, send it to the psychologist, we're here for this, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice for this profession, to make the world around you get involved in perfection with your demands.
But the context inside which this strategy emerges, in a very important way, are the relationships of coppy.
I remember one, a copy, during the collapse of which I didn't do anything else than listening to what, according to one, the other would have to change to solve the resources of their future.
He said, "Yes."
Yes, but of course you're to agree, but not even to prepare yourself in the Chinese.
And then it's a classicone, but she, no.
If you don't look for me if not for that.
And he doesn't, you know, you don't realize all the things I do for you.
And she, "No, if you don't listen to me, otherwise you'll do another well to meet me, and so you'll see the infinity of a lovely iron that always begins with the same word stretched."
Because we have to show all the equation line of the other, we have to make them see all the problems that should be cured to reproduce our happiness that has kidnapped us.
(Laughter) But the truth is that if this thing we often say it in a good ugly, believing us deeply.
We can hardly change something, elderly.
Instead of choosing the node at the base of the relationship, we end up enriching them to heal them, if the strategy that privileges them.
When things don't go as you want, the one to impose your need and wait for others to modify the consequence, think about a pair of times, because I'll have a life.
It full of resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, it's ...
To make sure there's no way, like a building, take the head, put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, there's the fear of facing the conflict that would emerge, then we should show our needs, and then what do we face them for the common good?
But in this way we don't even take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity.
And we live in the market, we need others.
I remember a young man in the young man, a young man in the young man, a son of separated parents, who, at the end of the first childhood, had learned to distress with great diplomacy between the tips of mom and dad, often spinning from the fear of one, would have lost the love of the other.
In this limited situation, I learned important things, for example, learned.
To listen, to accept, to think about motivations among them, even distant from one from the other, but on the other hand, I've never learned to say no.
The things they didn't go well didn't learn to say no to the relationships they were going to look for, there were any relationship condition, and elderly, it was one of those who had to always be media, but in this way they had to end their needs, their wishes, their ambitions, they were always undergoing to tell all how many.
It's the strategy that privileges, when things don't go like you're, is to suffer your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you, and instead of telling all of you, I'll end up failing.
(Laughter) To wake up, to impose your needs or to suffocate them, there are three limiting strategies, and I can say, with the means of cause, because I myself, in my life, have abused them, I tell you what happened to me.
One day, the primary of the hospital I collaborated sent me to call and said to me, "But Zuckeli, here for her, there's no more place, you have to continue the collapse with us, you have to accept a transfer."
And he told me a far away place, lost, detesitated from the most, or, above all, he would be able to go there to make a job that didn't even enter a big deal with everything I had studied until then.
I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, trying to make them change the idea, adopting, but sending that other, and even less because I'd never had to accept a commitment that for me was unbearable.
There you go.
But having different results would have had to do different things.
For the first time, of course, on my legs, at that moment, I realized that the secret to change the others.
It's changing yourself.
If it was changed me?
The others would also be able to follow, modify, change.
And if it was a super brilliant, complete, unique psychologist, the first one wouldn't send me to travel.
If I hadn't done it, the thing wouldn't have taken me more than so, old, maybe I'd have been there before I'd still get rid of it.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
But the answer didn't go to the other's fault, but I had to introduce myself in the profound of my own.
Responsability.
But why things?
They don't change.
We are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do?
It's in the direction of choosing us.
And you choose.
How does things cause?
That they don't go like you want.
You choose yourself as a cause of things that don't go as you want.
This is our bubble.
If I never find the work of the crisis, you're putting the only arms to your disposal.
Now we'll find ourselves alone and in a new language, if reading books, attending courses to acquire new skills, consolidate those who already have, you can work on you to become unique.
Because life is who does it.
Who doesn't do it?
He suffers it.
(Laughter) If inside the copy, things don't go well, you think it's the other to do the first step.
You're sending them a message of inadequality, and you're moving away, if you're part of you.
And maybe your own contributions, every day, this simple question.
So, what can I do today differently?
To make your best day.
So things change.
But they don't change, but they change because you are you who have changed before going to the research of their lacks.
Now she's looking for her needs.
And then I try to operate.
To be able to satisfy them.
And in this way, I create a mental space inside which we can take care of one another instead of making the war.
Audience: Yes.
You're one of those people.
It's clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose the sense of meaning, the things you do.
If you start to yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand which actions you put in the field to preserve them, then the game becomes something inside which you can become the pattern of the time.
It's starting to work on me, considering myself a cause of the things that didn't go as I wanted, instead of their simple effect that I also started to have to be a better person.
When I was writing to the university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to understand them that, with my matter, there were practical tools, sometimes even fast to bring great value inside their lives.
But friends, I met with a couple of...
Of problems.
Stereotypes, prejudices, psychologist is the doctor of the matters, the psychologist is the doctor of the debts, but I had to talk to a friend, but I went to the park, but what should I do?
I had to lament myself, or possible that I didn't tell you how beautiful psychology I had to try to change their mental priority, I had to drop my dream.
No, I had to.
To learn to speak a language, which was the one who didn't happen, as the next to the object, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to learn to listen to their needs.
Instead of imposing my own.
What's the turn of...
A little time, following this direction, I got results for me unimaginable.
When I finished my primary school and his transfer, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I didn't know what to do.
I thought about it, and finally I decided.
I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as he understood.
I'm transferred here.
I went home, I killed the computer, and I registered a video I carried on YouTube.
So, in which I spoke about psychology, here for the chronologist, I say, to take a few launch, because maybe you think it's...
In a short time, my YouTube channel has become a reference point in Italy for what psychologists look at in video thanks to this thing every day thousands of people are approaching psychology to discuss some of the stereotypes I mentioned before.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm in 79: I shared psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best schools in Italy, and I left my review.
I had to let myself down.
Because, obviously, they saw that my attempt to innovate the profession in a way to communicate it had something sense, and in Lombardia I was read to the president's vice-president.
The dreams.
They don't become reality, why?
For example, fortunately, or because you've had that.
The theory that must have is the one that keeps moving forward, who doesn't know how it is built and needs to distrugle you, because the culprit should do it.
It's also so much to discuss your identity, your points of belonging to your certainties, your habits of always.
And if there's something I learned from all this inner journey.
Audience: Yes.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but also the most urgent.
It must come to our internal.
Ten minutes ago I asked you a question.
If I had the chance to express a desire, one only to modify a aspect of your life, that doesn't happen like that.
What would you change, have we talked about work, physical perspective, the current story?
Well, in fact, I'd like to leave you with a gift, or at least to prove it, it's a small question that has personally been useful, and that is based on the logic that, to get to produce big changes, you have to focus on many small actions.
But what's the smallest thing?
And more simple.
That you could do until now, until the end of the afternoon, to return home after this beautiful day, and that will allow you to take the first step.
To put ...
Your life in the direction?
Here you're auspicious.
You can think, "What is the smallest, the simplest thing you can do?"
To put your life in the direction.
The ambitions.
"Dad."
"I have your keys of the fridge, I have to send them."
Or do you do it by yourselves, right?
But where do you put the bags?
Fairy, markets are the prove.
Obviously, now I call you.
I'm happy that it's time to change.
You can see when my mother comes.
Do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to talk for eight minutes.
And me, this?
I want to take this time by myself.
I had a dream.
To create a integration band.
A lot of diversity and diversity.
And percussions are so fast.
So, look, take the distances and unite the buildings.
Are we leaving?
We are part of seven.
You're young, I see them, I see Laura, Paola.
Daniel.
I saw them grow.
And our tests were the marketing.
The sea was the day of evidence, where it was inside this...
Studying in the Music of Andreoli.
They were driving in the first bidons, they were together.
The first waves together.
Then we decided to become an inventive mark.
KP: From there, we've increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical brands and via: the first brands, the first brands in the pieces, the first satisfaction, the first encounters.
The first satisfaction?
For the kids, for us, for everything we were doing.
But above all, the first applause.
Unfortunately.
One night of the 20th of 2012, the world fell down.
The real sense of the word.
All the cases were completely unbearable or crowned: a strong earthquake scope made our earths.
And from that moment on, we were.
The earthquakes of the thousands.
For all the inequalities, we were called this.
Audience: Yes.
As I said, the houses were...
Not more agible.
Many crossed: our proof, our place where it is.
Where there were all the Martians, it was completely distrustful.
The tools were inside.
What did we do?
I, the Sahara, Marco, Fede, Matteo, we all looked for them.
You have them in doppoli.
And the airlock?
We were able.
Luckily, we found them all.
We're all finished inside a tender, in a tender, in the thirst of manifesto, in the end of the media.
What's inside that tender?
There are magnificent things.
We've seen fear sounding stronger.
Because the bathroom of the bathroom sounds stronger than the earthquake: we looked at ourselves in the eyes.
With the Earth that was shaking?
To look for...
A smile.
A look.
The Earth was shaking.
Is it there?
We built the first tools.
The scary cests.
They became houses in the bank.
The tubes that have become...
The tools built and suited with ping pong racks, to remove them made with big houses, crashed.
We were constantly.
In continuous work, always, there was an amazing energy.
Although we were at a terrible moment.
The inside was born in our first protocol.
We decided to put on a real sponsor.
However, the group's components were increasing, the friends spent the word of 20 that we were, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We are part of the construction of the first protocol: the white.
Because it's the white man, because there were the smallest loops, the biggest loops, and the white genius.
At that moment, everyone was moving together.
Like a blank of lights.
Then, immediately after.
What did we do?
Last year, we did the other sponsors, the curve.
We became all marine.
Because we really wanted to navigate.
And to move for a moment of our Earth.
To breathe for a moment.
Then the year later we made a crack, this marine monster, immediately afterwards.
50 speakers, this flywheel.
And to conclude, that of this year, the sea of the Moon.
The sea is from the Moon.
We wanted to close a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There are many things inside this tenderness.
And none of us would never have thought that it's a tender?
It could change life.
Isn't it?
We did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
20 minutes are finishing.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems to me a favola.
150 concerts in turn for the History.
The first magician's stage?
The concert in the TV program at home.
Is it the lack of material?
We really did many.
And also to me, leaving the reals, because this is exactly me.
It's exactly the scenery of life.
The fatigue of the sweat, but also.
From the freshness.
It's a lot of possibilities in the future.
That's it.
What happens when a dream?
It becomes reality.
Now I have to come back from the fruits.
They expect me.
Is there still so much?
And to build.
Thank you all.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Ferradini, and in fact I was born as a lawyer, until the moment I asked myself what happened in the last 250 years.
250, very important years have changed radically our history, and that we live currently, we talk about social innovation.
And my question is: What is this social innovation?
And above all, our Italy, which is often so biased, is a ready country to incorporate this digital innovation, and ready to be tested at its time of innovation.
This is the digital metamorphosis: we all take it to us, close to us, an object, I believe almost everyone.
The phone is a technological solution that belongs to the Industrial Revolution, and yet, these three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new time, that we have, in some way, stubbornly, arbitrally in the 2000s, which we are living today.
But let's try to understand then what happened in these 3 in these 250 years, that summarize.
The Industrial Revolution, the Internet revolution and the Internet soldiers, the Industrial Revolution, when we remember it, we probably remember it as a Ferrovia.
What did we study?
In the school book, in fact, it wasn't just a Ferrovia: we, at the Industrial Revolution, are huge debates, they are normally debates, for example, because we need the vapor motor.
And the vapor motorcycle isn't just a vapor motorcycle, but, for example, that tool that has favored and has become faster, the United States of carbon, and the network is possible to a highly inferior cost, and it has started to change the modality, but it doesn't make it happen.
But we don't only have the motorcycle.
The vapor, we also need the scope motorcycle, because, on the other hand, it's an Italian invention, the motor is broken.
For example, we need the automobilistic industry.
In fact, before the Christmas industry, because the motorcycle was a motorcycle that couldn't go from fertile, when they were able to understand how to get that scent, to realize it as well, and it became that scent that has developed the automobilistic industry, and everything that has come to us.
But I'm not.
In the Industrial Revolution, we are still in debates, for example, for the phone: the phone is not only with the tool that allowed us to avoid the migration of these letters from one part to the other of the world, always more broader than we knew.
But is it also what has allowed us?
He taught us to deposit the caves.
Sout the sea.
And yes, because then you saw the phone, we couldn't try it in the sea, and then what did we do?
We interrupted everything.
No, if we went forward, standing on the sea, the first cavity to give a storal dimension was taken from Italy between medicine and registered the beach, not just two populations that came from agreement, but the first cavity was there.
And we are around 1858.
But I have the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know what we use it, brings it to our voice, in 187900 subscribed to Rome.
It's only 1877.
Another invention is electric energy, the first electric power center.
The continental, in Europe, was built via Santa Radagonda, where there is the Milan Renaissance.
Today there's the teenager, there, a time in 1873 was built the first electric center.
In that year, on December 30th, the scale was lit.
A part of our history was born exactly there.
Let's move forward, we try to make a little longer, and we get to 1950 the Italy has already grown, and it's getting to know a certain agency, for another, it has been a century.
It's still in the course, but that has already lived important staffs, and also important emotions from the futureistic point of view, but it begins to be born something, to compose something that has never been in the story before: they are the computer, which are calculators.
Three colors that, at the beginning of the '50s, could be in a stadium like this, and they had functions of neurocarcle, they simply read faster the calculation.
But they went forward and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors, they started to be the artificial intelligences we know.
At some point, it was decided to open these 50 years of the Internet revolution, and something else happened, there were research institutions, and above all, there were scopes of all the defenses that have led to develop these laws.
And these challenges, called ARPA, the network.
They became and started to be the website we know.
A diffused, or horizontal system, not hierarchical, extremely captured, capable of bringing information in 1981 were only 300 the computer connected to the Internet.
Not many.
Today, it's in the orders of the dozens of billion, because we're not talking about the computers we use, but of all these intelligent systems that connect to the network to care about data, to pick up data or to work for data.
But when the mechanical strength, which was to say replaced, that was introduced by industrial revolution.
It started to include the Artificial Intelligence of Computers.
And mobility?
And the Internet has had the time that, if we started to live the time we've lived now, that we're living now, the one that's called the Internet, and this second, a phenomenon of creative destruction.
Because I'm essentially an industrial process that tells us that what is new progressively destroyed what is old, because we need to do space, and we'll see better then how.
But this is the story of the great numbers, of the great inventions, but there's a story that is a little more human, that belongs to us a little more, on which I try to make a reflection, I try to accompany you.
It was 1863, when, little by little, the Italy hasn't made the Italians yet.
The Minister Mingetti, put in English finances, establishes that the 27th of the Middle Ages, is corresponded to the payment and public dependents.
And from 27 to the next months, that this happens.
And at this moment, even if we don't realize it, we're introducing ministers that are producing something extraordinary: before the wealth of a family, more than a singer, was in their ability to produce good services that were necessary to their own support.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky of the stages, less risky of the elevation, it started in some way to move away from the Earth.
And above all.
It has transformed the economic power of production.
In goods and services, in the power of production of one.
Well, the dwarf.
But there's a second aspect, which is the fridge for our women, and, obviously, was a revolution that has enough to read, but what, in fact, was the fridge.
It's that it's not only that object that liberates us from the emergency of going to do the spirit every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to preserve, in a massive way, a healthy way, in quantities of food.
So there's the possibility, once again, to focus on something that isn't.
Immediately, the use of everyday life.
And this is the man who begins.
To live to the end of November, these are us.
But, in time, how did we say it?
The speed, the speed of the challenges, the speed of the movements, the speed of our movement, and then there's a figure that has characterized these years, we today do the very fast things, and we move fast and the speed of our thinking that is not said quality of thinking, but we are very fast.
But until then something happened.
It's typically close when you look at the story, to understand the passengers from one century to the other, and sharing data that are not necessarily zero.
In 1900 - 1900 - 1900 - 2001, when we can say that it's finished the 20th century, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two data that are significantly segregated from a time to another, 2001 and 2008.
The American economy started to slow down, and on the other hand, there were Torri Gemelli, and so something in balance has started to change: these equilibrium that seemed solid.
But we went forward until there was something that has slowed all the time, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world, and the oriental world together, had never met, there was no only America to have slowed, almost closed, there was also the orientation.
In other words, there were Europeans who were to fail, the Greek was already the leaves of failure, they don't talk to us, but still there.
And it changed something.
But what has changed is changed the economic paradigm, we couldn't.
Not to wait for the biggest economic crisis that, in fact, was verified in 2008 and was crazy not to think about it, but how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension?
With many less people.
It was obvious that it would be dead: we were blind, we didn't know how to wait, look at these companies.
And what is this company?
Because they are stable multinationalities, in their majority, but above all, they are all companies that are Dante after 2011.
What did these companies do, don't they innovate?
inventing something, they didn't innovate building something that was before, but they started doing what we've always done, buying, selling, traveling, learning.
Learn.
The different way, the most efficient way.
And the Italy, which is often denied, we try to look at the state of absolute and digital Italy, according to 5 factors, connectivity, we are 10 percentual points under the media, but, honestly, we are almost close to a fast connection for 50 percent.
Anyway, something, according to human skills, human resources, competences of curving it, of a different being, between advanced and basic skills, and competences based on what allow us to develop them.
And a third picture we have to look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it.
A third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of the digital factor in productive processes.
So, comets, or industrialization of products and services, the fifth is digitalization.
The system of public administration: we immediately choose the field of some ambiguity, and we maintain the first two that are important: above all, a good news for everyone, all the five elements are increased.
It's all the five minds that are in a growth, in a growth speed, in a speed of growth in two years ago, so we're slowing the European countries, and this doesn't want to notice; on the other hand, we're building a very important and competitive tissue.
In fact, it was born a very profound change that is aligned to the European standards: there are two factors that have to look at us with great attention that will be key for our future of countries, and they are the skills and the inclusion of the digital in brutal factors.
And in this way we have to pay a lot of attention to the characteristics of our country, we have two engines.
The first driver?
It's what made the Italy in the '50s, it's the small companies.
And far from being, the little media.
Something not useful, not effective, not paragonable to large multinationals, in fact.
I'm probably the most effective entrepreneurial tool to interceive the speed of change: they're agile, they're fast, they're small.
And they know how to do something extraordinary that the Made in Italy has an excellence in the production of service, in the production of products.
It's pretty unique in their DNA, we all want it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, competences inside these realities, because these realities can become those multinationals that can help.
A internal segment of the market, the first great motorcycle, the second motorcycle that in Italy, is its cultural artistic heritage, and this is the first assault that we have, the first great technological way, we can't digitalize the crop.
But is it possible that tourists visit only three cities?
Venezuela, Rome, and then they distribute.
But the wealth of these three cities don't do the wealth of our country, and we're learning, maybe we've tried to start, but we're fast to recover, to include this heritage, not only to visit three centers, but to visit all our country.
The topic I spoke about in a certain sense is the opposite action of the word.
What does it mean?
What is all this?
Our encounter is the opposite of the word "share," because I'll talk not about sharing, but in a certain sense of the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'll talk about inequality, I'd like to start first.
Well, with a question.
But if someone asked you?
To Brussia Pelo.
Secondly, in the last 15, 20 years, we say, in the 21st century.
The inequalities in the world, the inequalities of law between the citizens of the world are increased or decreased.
But I believe most of you will answer.
I'm increased, if you were the journalists, maybe you'd add the precious goal, they've increased exponentially.
Well, that's me.
I asked you, "But is it in Italy?"
Perhaps the answer of many would also be.
I asked myself these questions in the last few years, and with the only 24th and the foundation of video.
I prepared with my friends a report.
In inequalities, from when they are artists, that is, financially, from 1960 to the majority of the countries in the world.
"Yes."
The result is what you see.
This is the curve of the disguised inequality between the citizens of the world, as you can see, there was indeed an increase of inequalities, especially in the 80s, but from now on.
From the end of the last century, in the end of the 90s.
The compessive inequality between the citizens in the world is crowned, precipitated, now we're at the storal mining.
In Italy, we must understand that inequality is quite complicated, even here we have an increase throughout the 80s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second public.
AC: We have a trend of decreasing inequality.
How can we read these data?
Well, a possible reading is to say, "We've traveled a collective bathroom because we continue to talk about years of argument of inequality, how much data doesn't support our feeling.
And there's really, surely in this reading, but we could also ask ourselves another question: What if the feeling of an increase of inequalities that many of us have the same?
Do we have it?
(Laughter) It wasn't wrong the feeling, but it was wrong the idea of inequality on which.
We reason.
Perhaps.
We must reflect on the issue of inequality, on what we understand, for inequality.
Perhaps the concept of inequality requires some rethink.
We leave this question temporary and we move around a century.
And also, we move to Cambridge in 1928, a year before the great Church of the 29th, Lickens.
That was Cambridge, there was a speech in front of you.
It has a student audience, a speech became then famous with the title "Posibility Economic for our grandchildren," in that occasion, "Keynes forms two professions."
It was a century, productivity.
But from a workplace, it will be...
Other times the one of today, that is 1928.
And this trade, in fact, is made because if you went to take it.
The construction of the stories of the economy.
Indeed, most of the advanced society, we have an increase of productivity in the turn of 100 years, which is also said.
Ten, twice times, in some case, 15 times, so this teacher was also fulfilled, but from this teacher Keynes also found a consequence, an idea, that is that humanity, little by little, that is to say, has been lost for a few years.
To work less.
And he also said, to work everyone, and he saw a problem for this, because the question that was asked Keynes, but with all this time, he knew a lot about me, he understood a week of 15 hours of work, or not.
Okay.
Apparently, this second path wasn't made.
Because we all see it, that we don't all work, and it doesn't seem exactly what we work three hours a day.
I'll show you that this teacher is divided in two parts: there's one that says we'll all work, it's certainly false, but the first part.
We'll work a lot less, we'll work three hours a day, we're sure it's not done anywhere, we'll see what happened in Italy.
This curve, this trajectory, represents the time fraction.
It's an Italian, medium.
And the interesting thing is that this 16% - if we look at this trajectory - which, in fact, is made, because we were at the beginning of 900, almost 40% of our lives naturally working in their life, that is, for 15 years, when we are able to compare a job.
"Fa."
Two hours and a fourth a day, that is, the barrier of the three hours we have already collapsed in Italy.
Naturally, if this happened, there are also reasons.
Obviously, and if you want a bank, for example, the old age is enormously aligned.
Because we die very much later, life expectancy is that it's something like 27 years old, it's also been studying for 25 or 30 years, so there's also a more fundamental reason for which, from the beginning of the last century, from 900.
Our quote of time?
Dedicated to work and crowned.
And it's the test of occupation, that is, the number of people who work.
This is the storal series of total occupation.
It's built for this occasion.
It's this dramatic series, because it makes you see what?
At the beginning of the century, in all monarchical era, before the Second World War, the occupation rate was even better than 70 percent.
Today we're very low, we're around 50 percent scarce, old from 1968 and around a year, the occupation rate has always been inferior to 50%.
But a rate of inferior occupation to 50 percent, what does it mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, that is, pure consumers who don't perceive any network are more workers.
In front of this?
In fact, storal, we can also have a relationship.
It's enthusiastic and say, "But this is the progress of beauty and modernity?"
Things went like this because we can allow it, but then we see if, in the country that the modernity's problem, that is in the United States, things went in the same way, because if this interpretation is fair, it should have happened in the United States, and then we see the confrontation.
Let's go.
Italy.
You were united.
This is the storal series of time.
It's dedicated to work in life, as you can see, in the United States it's only, until the '30s, then it's established, and it's the storage series of the occupation rate, because here we see.
That even has a increase, that small one you see below is the crisis of the 29th, we have a general tendency of the occupation rate in the United States, at the increase, but in our case we have a situation.
Riduation.
It's the occupation task.
But then, this ...
In Italy, it's a pathology.
It's not normal.
"What?"
But they are more people who consume without producing than the people who produce.
It's not normal that the majority of the population lives in a condition that I'll define.
"Dipendency parassitary," "dependence," because I depend on the network you are.
This tube can also be a family or the State, but to the Italy, because I consume or the available network without working.
I, a friend who does theater's act, when I found these results, we were in the scene and I asked them.
You, how would you represent this situation with an image, a situation of parasitary dependence, and you know what has answered to me?
With the hypothesis, it's that light that lives on the sphere of the hypothesis, but it's called buffag, some say buffaga, here it is.
If you want to have an idea of how it behaves.
The bubble or the bubble on the prototype, or on the other big mammals, these birds also live on the bridges, on the bubbles, well, we have this film that will treat us for a few seconds, in which you can see.
These...
These fish.
How do they live?
If the bubble is happy with the eye that mistakes can mean that it's playing on the resources that the bubble provides, which are in sects, larvae, and that all that the bubble is affected by the light.
Anyway, this is the sociologist, so the question I asked myself as a sociologist.
As we can define a situation of this kind, as we define a society in which there is a majority of pure consumers and a minority of producers.
There's this kind of productive consumption, the first one I said to myself, "But this is the ignorant society?"
And society, gentlemen, like the feudal society, in which there's a ceiling that has put in the condition of living without working.
But, naturally, it's not enough: you have to add a qualification.
What could be defined?
The ladies and gentlemen society, but it's a mass society.
(Audience) Yes!
Because consumers are more producers.
And here, the clear report is a relationship of commanding and subtomission: in the ignorant society of the globe that produce for him, in society, in society, gentlemen and simple society, we have the gentlemen and the serves of the globe that produce for him.
The relationship between signs and producers is much more complicated, because Greek Dubezon, a great psychologist and psychologist, would have defined it a relationship of Oppio Legame, we see why.
The relationship?
From bubble with the hypothesis and parasitism, and this is a advantage signed in green, but it's also dependence, because it depends on food that is on the sphere of the body.
Because we can't, we can't nourish the birds that live in the bubble, but it's in some way, in a report of obligation, as we are, in the face of green, the autonomous face doesn't need its spices, so the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of doppy legacy.
That doesn't go well.
Is it a situation in which?
"Wow!
A new problem of inequality, and now we get there.
The question I had asked about Keynes: today, perhaps, the real inequality and the inequality of access to work?
The access to work is very similar to our social system, but if inequality and access to work we can use the tools of the analysis of inequality, that is to calculate a concentration of genius, which is the tool with which they don't work, that have a job that has two jobs.
And the position of the History, in this scale of inequality of access to work, is dramatic: the position of the History is to be penous in the graduation.
It's Turkey.
In the country where inequality reaches the maximum, but simply because there's the exclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, we would probably have the palm of this creator, the best situation, the one of Norway, with the United States, in the middle.
They need us to become an Oxis country, normal, seven million jobs positions.
How did we get to this: this is the story of inequality of access to work in Italy, always measured in any kind of genius, you can see something clamorous, that inequality is the minimum during the work positions in more, our families?
But here I conclude, there would be 1,000 euro a month in more, we would have 12,000 euros to spend, as much as the health and the school put together, more or less in Italy, and our State would have 150 billion euros to spend, there's a word.
Nights.
We have the scholarship to write in the first article of the Constitution, the History is a democratic Republic based on work, we are the only country.
It has this in the first title of the Constitution, and we are the worst country together with the Turkey of the West.
So, we change things.
And we created the seven million jobs that lack, or maybe better to cancel the article one of the Constitution.
Because, being so, things sound like a bubble.
Thank you.
