In 2016, I was given a award: from the National Forum Forticing Learning, supported by the Ministry of the United States in Irlanda, from the name a little particular, they were born in Church.
The motivation of this award was my availability in the confrontation of the students and my ability to create less formal, more relaxing environments, let's imagine that this is a big university class.
The usually entered class.
I think this is the first step to create data environments, the first ten minutes, when students enter and get there, I put my computer to explain and put a classic music, and try to maintain the attention of the students.
Unfortunately, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a method used until the old age.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, the storytelling is a method based on the use of narratives.
To transmit knowledge to students.
And just with this method that I'd like to start my lesson explaining to you to describe a topic about the mouth of everyone, already: artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that children tell, I'd like to start my story once.
Second World War.
In 1942.
The UK region.
Blece and Park.
A north residence of London.
And there was a young and 30 years old.
Alan Turing.
Listen to Laureal King's College of Cambridge, and they get a research doctor in logic, at the Prince University, in America.
At that time, the Tedes used a machine.
A special, enigma.
It was a machine to write.
The operator digitalized details, but since stuck on a paper, those letters, I stuck other letters, according to a code imposed mechanically under the sea.
The texts used this mechanism to communicate with them.
Anyone would interceive this paper in front of you without any sense.
It was shouting.
Alan Turing was one of the main figures in Blece Park.
Keeping and building them a machine.
It's the one you can see, behind, able to decipher these tests written by theedes.
For this invention, we think that war is finished with two years of anticipation, saving many human quickly.
In the adventure, continuously, after the war, to do its logical research.
And it's considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
So, with your Turing machine, he formalizes the computer thing, even before the computer was created in practice.
In 1950, an article published on the "Mind magazine."
Computing machine and intelligence.
But where does the test propose?
The question behind the testing is a very precise one.
They can think machines.
From here, artificial intelligence began.
Probably many of you have seen the movie of Emitation Game, the game of limitation, I want to explain to you.
But do we suppose there's a person here?
The digital prosecutor is the computer that asks questions and on the other hand of the end, a machine M is an operator.
In an alternative way, the machine M and the speaker or form the answers to the person standing.
It's said that the machine takes over that Test Turing if the person is not able to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the operator, this is the limitation game.
But the vehicle must have special characteristics to overcome the test.
But it must interpret natural language.
The question that comes from the person must represent knowledge to form the answers.
In other words, we must think in an automatic way to form these answers.
And it must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence: one of these is cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this process, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to capture thinking in the moment they are in, or we try to modify the thinking at a psychological level.
That's why artificial intelligence is said that if we can really have a fedal representation of human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of the laws of the rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man?
All the men are mortal.
Socrates are dead.
This is a deductive argument.
According to two primary legs, it's dedicated to a real conclusion: it's trying to build educational arguments and get them into a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational agents.
A rational agent, an entity.
(Laughter) It must act.
It must be adapted to the context.
And it must be carried out objectives, and know how to take them to end.
And it must act in a rational way.
So the Turing test is linked to intelligent people, reformulating the Turing phrase, a machine to think, we can say, "Can we create a machine?"
An artificial agent.
I'm able to think, exhibit intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence, so it's the purpose of creating artificial entities, intelligent, your phone is an entity.
Among the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence as psychological construct.
Once we have more knowledge.
What about this?
It's close to build artificial, intelligent identity and support of man, it's a cycle.
But do we see today?
If machines can think.
I'd like to explain to you to describe the state of art of artificial intelligence and I'd like to use five classes to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We have subtle agents.
For humans.
We have the optimal agents - I want to explain to you with some examples - optimal agents are those who manage better than all humans, and we can't do better, for example, agents that solve the cube of Rubik, already with a four in the best way, which is capable of developing in zero, 73 seconds.
But do we have sovereign people?
Why do they act better than all people?
For example, in the game of the rocks.
In the game of the scary.
A few years ago, the Russian Scakis camp was killed by an artificial agent.
We have people who suffer humans, those who manage almost like all people, for example in the game of Poker Texano.
To answer the question of the ketchu.
We have teeth for the mother.
What do they act?
Almost like all people, for example, in cognitive activities like the crowned words or the massification.
And finally, we have subtle people who manage the worst of all people, for example, are the case of objects.
The recognition of caligraphy, the vocal recognition, the translation of a language to the other.
But if there's something that artificial agents, today, are not able to do, for example, have a disambiguation: we're talking about the fruit like this.
The mum, or are we talking about the Marco of the body Apple?
It's something that agents are not able to do, it's the region in the ideal world, in uncertainty situations.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence, for which we think we are far from overcoming the test.
Let's see now in the future.
They will be able to think.
A few years ago.
In America, a thing was introduced by the name of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest experts in artificial intelligence in the world.
Imagine the time line.
Imagine a line that indicates human intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a red line that indicates the machine intelligence with an exponential warming, this blind moment.
The previous setting in the wall's laws, for which computational compassion, for example, measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, radiated for two years and in four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to make this computer complexity to simulate the human brain.
I don't see anything.
Well, in 2020, we would have access to 1,000 dolls to this computer capacity.
In 2025, secondary and crossed, I'll never be able to get rid of our brain in a precise way.
And finally, in 2029.
But machines will spend the test, they will overcome the test.
And then, in 2045, and the indication of the moment it will have the technological singularity.
In which machines will follow the intelligence of the machines and will follow an exponential environment that will radically change human intelligence.
In his article.
It's published on the mind, Turing didn't only proposed its test, but it also proposes new objections against its same test.
These objections are us, butions against artificial intelligence.
A few years ago.
I was a student at the University of Varese.
I followed a course of ethical episode of ethics and ethics of computer science, given by the Gaithan professor, Aur√©lio Lanzerone, and I was the only one who proposed a decade formulated, with mathematical intelligence.
Take a look at human stupidity.
But I want to describe it in simple terminals: let's suppose to take the intelligence of all people, to put the seed, the symbol of submission to the minister side of the equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine, so we get an intelligence equality, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were, to transfer our intelligence inside a hand?
And this becomes more intelligent than us, it's also true that we've left the machine to become more intelligent than us.
So to conclude my story.
And by getting rid of the initial question, the machines can think.
I'd like to leave you with an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
How many of you have taken pictures today?
Thank you.
OK, well, this gives me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in the bathroom, and it serves everyone, I'm the creative director of a study that takes care of photography, and I've spent many photos with their phone, which doesn't make me a photographer, I've spent the last three years.
This is me, immersed among my meters, but there are many other things that there is in the production of a scenario, in part of a new language, in order to influence the aesthetics of the vision that the forms of compassion, this is only one of the contemporary models, or so contemporary photography, which changes the product and self-professional photography.
To find answers to these questions, I tried to open a confrontation.
With future editors, careers, critical and theorists, who have embraced the challenge of this new means, I asked them to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the successes, of their shared and images through the cell phone.
To find answers, I looked around, and I arrived in New York, at the South of AIM, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock, in Parigi, in the rooms in which photography is distributed and puts itself in context, and understand how the photographer changes these ingratulations.
(Laughter) To find answers, I tried to look beyond the surface of the great common places of the contemporary.
For example, selfie, for example, the selfie to get involved, simply to a delirium narcissive as some psychologists have sustained with the body dismorphism, or can't be seen as a health of the generation of the millennials, as a global warming.
Look at the slower.
The phyto-binding aesthetics that has signed and still segregated our mobile vision: this is my cane, Zazi, designed by my photographic experiments, is simply the result of a world's world's worldwide, or, instead, as it has sustained the social and historical vision, even economical.
And at what point we are, the story of the photographer is short, but in a few years, or in a lot of millions and millions of people, a new code that, above all, has tried to draw a map, if not to find the route, at least to understand what we are, is the territory of interpretations, and of this phenomenon of the planet.
A global dialogue, or a collective world, if you want, that has impressive numbers: every two minutes, today, we scat more images of how many humanicans have been taken in the interaction of the year century.
In addition to 350 million of these images are carried every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram: the production, the diffusion of images, of activities that, until a few years ago, looked at a direct amount of professionals in which we define ourselves through the images we produce, or better.
And if the mobile photographer is a new language, then it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that is still strongly drawn by that process of liquid that affects them daily, like the typical of a modernity, the one that structures the work, the family, the copy, are always more fascinating, and here actors are based on the instant gratification of our need of sharing.
But in a world where each one, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone, which remains the professional photographer, and that differentiates passing by accidental and conscious photographs.
On the one hand, the facility of using the cell phone camera, taking into account the process of democratization of photography, started with the era Kodak and arrived until the iPhone.
On the other hand, the use of the cell phone as a reward tool offered to professional photographers.
The new possibilities in approach to the stories, the contents, the subjects, even from one part, the opening to everyone, to all of us, of a dialogue channel, with an exclusive audience, as a producer of images.
But on the other hand, you've tried to think that the possibility of directly putting ourselves in the use of the newspapers, a chair based on a photographic photographer in the last few years, a photographer and journalism image, which, for example, has dedicated to the conservation of the universal patrimony of the European Real Profession of the Regism, which has always been able to &amp; Economic Fotography Fotography, for &amp; Fotography, for &amp; Fotography, &amp; Fotography, &amp; Fotography, &amp; Fotography, &amp; Fotography, &amp; Fotography, &amp; Fotography, &amp; Fotography, &amp; Fotography, &amp; Fotography, &amp; Fotography, &amp; Fotography, &amp; Fotography,
Benjamin Loui.
Oronna VIP, who has used and use the smartphones in conflict territory, showing how the agility and the description of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of deepness, photography as a cup that belongs to a simple smartphone, has explored new paths for the first hand.
Bread Mengin, who used it for the Sport photography, the exclusive territory of photography with hyper-performant walls, told me that he made a vehicle of denounces, going back to the Afro-American Community of Brooklyn, and creating an attempt to the parts around his job.
MTIX that uses it daily to build its family album, inerting a reflection on how Instagram changes the facts of our privacy, and the way we build and preserve our visual memory.
Peter of Campo, who, through the Countain Ever of Africa, dedicated to the story of a daily and normal Africa, beyond the media stereotypes of photographic materials.
Like Stephan of Luigi who interpreted the Omer's history with the cell phone, telling in the series AIV, one of the oldest heritage of the Western history, with the most new vision tool, or how did they do these photographs, that we don't know how to do?
To tell, walking to the outskirts of action, or looking for personalized tags on the event, to avoid more than recording.
Creating images that are never straightened to reality, but that are born from a deep interaction between photography and content to be broadcast on different platforms and reaching different audiences, making network, using innovative connections, puncting in a powerful way, to distinguish ourselves from the visual rumor of the world that defines us to the eyes.
All of this, I believe, makes the difference between a photograph that was the real resource.
Her bullying, reproduction, her self-reference and sharing, and a photograph that, in fact, can still be a cultural metaphor, thank you.
And do you feel it?
I felt it like that.
What we believe is silence.
And actually?
It's 50 ERC of electrical race.
Fifty-thirds that are immediately entered in our lives.
And we wake up from the illusion that silence exists.
I didn't exist to myself.
So also in this room, those proofs, these seeds, and put a 50-year-old frequency.
So, do you imagine, right?
I went home after a job day, really stressful.
Please, with your partner, with your partner, except you're going to read in the bubble of your bed camera and think you're alone.
But no.
There's always her.
But this frequency of 50R.
Because I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible, in our cases, in our lives, but it's more or less this sound.
Let's see.
A positive one.
Or better, first of the negative aspect.
The silence doesn't exist.
But we have a positive aspect.
But we are never alone.
There's always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Very good.
It's harmful.
And if we look at it, as a drawing?
This frequency of 50 times is nothing more than a sound wave: a wave is now with a beautiful rich spectrum, with which you can make music, and then I've asked myself.
But why?
Why not make us music?
That's it.
I'm a composer of sound colonies, an artist, I'm now a little special, why?
I was complicated life deciding to make music alone and exclusively through rumor.
My parents?
So they divorced when I was little.
That's it.
I know, you think this is the classic story in Strappa Lacre, but it was the revelation of my life.
In the loneliness of those days, in the weight of the void of that house, I started to make music with all the rocks around us.
So ...
Each income complement was no longer.
A classic fulfillment of network, closed, immobile, before voice.
But it becomes my musical tool.
With a joy among the other of my mom, who every roof didn't find the bikes, among the other hand, Macciao, was looking at me from the streaming, and that's it.
I say, at some point.
I tried to become...
I was a normal person, trying to say, "I've tried because I started studying Chitarra, piano."
Then I liked Woody Allen, so I started to create the grandson, the problem I really liked Arenzo Arvor, who wrote a beautiful song in Bigoa, was coming like the first years of study in Genova.
I also quit Clarinetto.
That's how, to not go...
I make the illusions of my classmates.
But why did I abandon all this, why did I study and escape from that notation so rigid?
Because there's more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more sponsor in a rumor, and I like to paragonate it to the problems of life.
All of us have attacked a rumor, a failure, something that made us think, but I'm sure that this rumor made us grow much more.
From a smile.
So, what is my mission?
When I'm a child, it's to transform a failure, a rumor in music, and to harmonize everything around me.
Let's go.
Because I would have been able, I say.
To make me a beautiful turning point, Gino Paoli, and everything would be concluded, but no, I was complicated in this way life.
What is sound?
But above all!
What is the study, and with the saying, is one of the most difficult senses to understand, but also the most immediate, the most powerful.
To transmit an emotion: our inner eye, the protein of the oceans, our team, reaches the maximum functionality around the fifth week of gesture.
I say this week of gesture, this means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to listen even before seeing, and this is not a case.
Because the fact must be ready to what the hospital in life, once born, must be ready to the dark text, it shouldn't be afraid.
It must be ready, so, in a case, if the mother, during pregnancy, listened to Pancroco British, hasn't been stupid if the child, once he was born, will be listening, for example, Shakespeare.
So, future, moms, I prepare you, and it's a richness that I personally pay attention to the musical choice: wait for the trap, more than another, OK?
But what is sound?
"Yes."
And the sound is that one.
It's all that we're surrounded, and sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what, in our lives, is completely scared: you don't see, you don't touch, but the colony is time for every day, the rhythm in our partner, the mother who screams us, because the mother screams us, still.
All of this is the sound colony of our days.
That's it!
Of course, the visual is much easier: we know it.
The visual is when we enter the system's hair, we say.
It's smaller than how I imagined them.
But it's smaller than what, there's smaller than the man of Milan.
The smaller than San Pietro, the smaller you have, maybe.
It's the same as when a person sees me in the video, or on the stage, and then I tell you a person, and says to me, "I imagined higher, of course, because it would be really impossible."
So that's it.
Going from this budget, the visual.
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, did I say it?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's imagine our lives, I'd like to genuine your ability to observe, so we're in vacation.
We're in the sea, not in case, and we started.
I'm going to take pictures of my feet, in the wisdom, then the kilometers are not, I'm not in another prosecutive, then it's taken from the bottom, we don't do it, but also those, then there's the open air, so we call a drone to kilometer, a lot of sensory, but a lot of food that had a certain point of sne.
That's it.
Audience: Yes!
But nobody eats the doll.
We photograph it.
We look at it, we do so many videos, but we never stop listening.
We never stop listening, but not even a person we know.
And I teach you a trick: when do you connect with someone?
The best moment to know the person is to stay in silence, that silence that, among the other, doesn't exist: go for two, is it?
Listen, close and listen.
Like in this moment.
So, today I'd like to take you with me, I'd like to bring you with me.
I went around the world, I ended up evolving it.
And your perception of listening.
And I'd like to start by telling you...
For the first time, the dream of my life was 2013, I wanted to run away from the adventure, a series of failures, problems as much as the other, the dream of my life, the dream of my life that was born from the listening of myself, which has later turned into harmony, but I think of looking for a long place of the History.
So, I decided to choose a city on the front.
Well, there was still a lot of fear: I had an idea, but I was the only one to believe us, and it was the one that would have listened to the sounds of the whole world, of all the cities of the world, creating for each sound, of every city, calling this project "Sound of Syria."
And the whole part, really, from the sound of the cities, the cities are a great musical tool to wake up this musical tool, you can enter the last of the cities.
And I'd like to take you to this moment to Shanghai, where for 48 hours, I'm not registered, the sounds of the city.
And I created a sound colony, so at this moment.
I want to sound: Shangah.
The enemy!
My name is Caio.
In Ivo Vat√∫, I think I'm here today.
In my heart.
Thank you very much.
(Audience) Beautiful!
Chorus: Here.
(Audience) Deep!
[A.DE.]
I feel guilty, guilty!
(Livox voice) (English) I accepted to stand up.
(Music) (English) I'm tired of it, I'm tired of it.
(Video) (English) I'm tired of the air of the air.
(Video) (English) Hi, I'm a little bit scared.
Time?
(Applause) You were still focused on the visual.
And this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, let's say.
You've all stuck to the visual.
Now, there's a city that's sure, you've photographed in every way, and you're wondering more than once, but that smoke that comes to the tombs that are made, but the bridge of Brooklyn can sound.
Yes, the bridge of Brookly is an exceptional that is located, completely online.
And do you want to join?
That's it.
Or the Counter, who is really touched on the side, is something very important to say.
Beautiful, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because on the other side of the world.
It's not magical because it's on the other hand, it's magical because under our eyes, every day.
And maybe many of you know a pair of places.
Well, in this picture.
The sound rule is 48 hours.
And without sleeping around a city, losing themselves in the same city, well, I knew Genova.
I knew Genova because there were many times, I had evolvedly captured many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that between my favorite cities, now, scaven the applause.
Thank you.
I started to record the first sounds, and the first sounds were given to these children, which in this tube.
So, from Ferro, an old man, they gave me this audio campaign.
And I'll make you feel, before the Greek camp, and then, that's worked.
Let's go to the span of...
Great.
And I like a puzzle - I've always done it - that I've never been - I've attacked this beautiful and replaced me a very low frequency that has become a synthesis.
MM: Of course, Genova is Mordandis.
(Laughter) It wasn't a battle, this is a serious thing.
Let's give the world.
And the writing, which you see constantly in the beach of Ferrari, is not just a writer, for me it's a great musical tool, helped me to support the beat of this column sound, and it's more or less like that.
The last sound, after I really want to sound like Genova, is the one of all the boats of the port.
That we are used to look at the top, but the sound of a tragedy that gave me a particular frequency that became the melody, and when I created this microphone, I immersed it for 48 hours in the Genova's port, I found a sound voice.
That's it.
It's true.
Well, now I wanted to make you feel Genova, but I came to this point, "No.
Here's Genova as a sound.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
This is the sound of our passions, in my and your passions, and for how many people will tell you that they're rumorous, they're stuck outside time, you really want to listen to them, and I'll always bring you to listening, thank you!
As it's said Guybek in Italian, the word generally used is restitution, it's not perfect, but the idea of the idea, in generating the idea of restitution linked to monetary restitution to beneficence.
A lot of times, instead, the restitution is linked to reproduce what you did, what you learned.
And going from the part of those who say, "It doesn't work anything," then in Italy it doesn't work anything in this country, we try it, so the next 18 minutes will share some point of this story.
Going from the end of the '90s, precisely, this is my son's army.
At the same time, my monkey organized the funds to pay the asylum material, it was an activity.
Very heavy, made with many parents, some of them said, "No, why should we help, we must think about the common state, but most of them make these extraordinary efforts?"
To help the asylum to help the community.
It has collected a million 200,000 allies, because I don't remember, I'm 600 euros from then on.
And it was one of the individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later, we take the United States, this is similar, the same similar school for a neighbor's school, this is the biggest child.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we realize that it's a totally extraordinary reality.
In other words, the thing of the game Beck of the restitution is very normal.
So the extraordinary effort of a magnitude of Italian parents is ordinary for all that society: I said this, the concept of restitution, I've had fortune, I've had the school, I've helped the university, I've helped the museum, the theatre, there's all the communities, financially, they've been based on this.
I'm ten years old, some of you may have known it, this is the sidth launch of the famous Obamaker.
The site that says, "Desistemy is from now on."
Trump is trying us very actively to ask ourselves if the system is given at the moment.
Obama has launched the famous bank, and there was an incredible technological debate.
Technological advance has been 600 million dollar, so not worried about these things that didn't happen only in Italy.
They build a site that doesn't work, many million contacts, and this is the standard answer they receive, in short, believes that it doesn't end for a few days, but then someone stopped criticizing, and it's enough to do, to criticize, to help, which is difficult, extraordinary, for us, it's not a common thing.
This is Time Magazine's coverage, which refers to the experts of technologies sent by Google and other companies, has been offered, and I agree with the Bianca House, they have no clues, they've been in a few weeks, at a decim of the costs.
I would probably have criticized, "But Google, surely, your interests are this."
And the extraordinary effort, and not the ordinary, I've seen that I've finished at TEDx's coverage, it's very interesting, it's what I want to explain from what was spinning, I'm spinning from people, that still.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this suit, this bag, and they decided to reproduce the experiences that had filled their lives, experiences.
In this case?
But they look at the ability to manage big technological systems, complex, unbearable, repeatable processes.
To make them again possible and unbearable, and create a replicable system that is the USA, this effort was born.
A system replicates what we hope to do with us.
But I want to talk about the word model, because one also implies the models, which are the models that are part of this bag, that we need to use, we want to reproduce.
For me, obviously, it has played not only what we said until now, but also the Italy factor, almost 20 years ago, the idea of helping there was also because I'm Italian.
And I wanted to do it exactly: Do you know what Ray is?
To do or not do, there's no attempt, maybe the Italian river is to do or not do it, there's only to criticize.
A few years later, we're five to meet Mateorence without Francesco, and the Visicom Valli came to the sensibility of the general transformation, something that has discarded us a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of processes, for the digital transformation of the public administration.
I ask myself, because it doesn't come to help us in Italy for a couple of years, I think it's reflected in the regret of not thinking, between a few years I think I've tried and I haven't managed, or I think I'm not even tried.
The choice was made, and so it goes to the Rome for two years, in the middle of Amazon.
But those who have to do it, Molina Amazon, Probono, Maiday, something will give you underwater, these are only many phrases, I have to say that we've also received so much support, so at this moment we're focusing on this part, but in a positive part there was.
But I was mentally preparing the skeleton and the bureaucracy, people ask me, "But do you expect these little bubbles, and yes, I didn't expect it, of course?"
But scientificism isn't often cynicism that characterizes you a certain mentality, it will never make it, of course, because you have rights, I've heard a lot of this kind, and this country will never make it the sense of common good.
And to do things because you think of helping, to improve a situation not only because it's not interested.
And here's it: for the days of you, this is a commission, for the most elderly you recognize it, as a black comistry.
And I say this because the beautiful title, my movies, after the beginning of extraordinary commissioners, is simply because it's the rule that allowed me to be able to take people out of the public administration.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is, as the systems from inside don't become, we want to try to transform them with people who come from outside, where the fact that they don't know the administration public is a asset, and they don't have the ability, it's a advantage and not a disadvantage.
So, financially, we created a small team, we wanted a small team to read 25 people, a large world, but it's also too small, of technological experts around 80%, the 20% inspired by making legal, legal, governative, communication.
Here you can see the post I had done when, by myself, I started this adventure, I said, because we don't write what I think will happen, in this way we want to attract talents, the talents you live in Italy, or that you want to come back.
It's also temporary, it has a very well-being compensation of what you see, as I'm convinced, so I've put myself in the idea, but how do I convince someone to do the same thing I'm doing here, in the 47s, all the United States, in this massive sport, of investment of infrastructure?
We created the vision that the operative system of the country is a series of fundamental components that can build simpler services for citizens, the public administration and companies, a very beautiful vision of implementation, is "lacrime and blood."
I've continued in my place: soccer field in Salita, and the American soccer, I'm wrong.
We've already tried many rules, complicated, sometimes incomprehensible, it's a easy prediction: we must learn to manage with intelligence and bureaucracy, many of them will not understand how public administration works, and we've already tried in many, they've failed in Italy, it doesn't work like that.
And I continue?
We'll get many criticisms: some comments will be useful, others will be tiny and prejudices, the criticisms of the first type riding of people who want to really offer their contribution and have found them a lot.
The second type of color they want to defend the state of the school is that they always see the bubble in the middle of the void.
Or that, simplerly, the power is drawn, and this is our problem.
To teach things that don't work.
Remember this image: the first, men and women on the cover of Time Magazin.
That's it, here, so, despite I tried to scare the most possible people to do with the eye, I received about 3,000 questions, and we immediately started to operate, what do we do?
In fact, we take care of Draulica.
These are the tubes of the administration public, some of them to do a lot about connecting, because the big problem is that the systems, the applications, anything that should be interconnected, and asylum, don't connect.
And I'm not only talking about machine-machine, I'm also talking about people who don't want to explore their own data, their own software, their own applications.
So it's introduced to the concept, to explain it, and in years to implement it, to connectivity, to interruptability.
It's sponsoring the code of public administration.
The scores show us the software, of course, and make so much activity of management, so so much hydraulic activity.
But we can't also be pictures.
To make the services of the beach, in time, you have to make them better, to make them easier, to make them easier.
Well, all these things are done in parallel, but without the tubes you can't do the chest.
After a few months, in the midst of 2017 we wrote the piano "Trienna" to the Administration Transformation, we did together with the agile of other people who helped us, which has particularly one thing.
Two are written in a clear, technological way, but also in the process.
For the first time, it was assessed and sponsorized by the government, the gentlemen has affected the decrease of the presence of the minister, the digital staff is a priority of the government, the triennal piano.
But it requires a team game to simplify public administration, the city of the citizen, particularity of the piano.
Well, one day a year, because the pieces can't be static, especially in technology.
Thank you.
And it's appreciated to administrations, what is this, this is the only way to make the pieces in Italy, in the public administration?
It's regulating the technological rules and you read exactly three pages of view and connections to other norms in other things: we can't talk to other things: so the trendal plan is put on Guitab, the technology, the public administrators, the software, the software, or not.
And to improve it.
Instead of dedicating this moment, particularly, and this is always a part of the piano to the digital platforms: digital payments, one, electronic positions, electronic letter, which is a habitant platform, digital identity.
And the greatest project that we've followed is called national and President's population.
In the beginning of what I've been managing, manually, and then I have to tell you all the citizens that are at this moment on 8,000 different levels, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, in the only Database, where data is talked about a common to the other, I have to say, all those things I've already had to know.
Well, we're solving a technological solution, then we'll do so much about the process.
Two weeks ago, we made a series Akaton.
where 800 software educators have worked on that brilliant application, they were used in 96 interventions, Bagfixing, so they brought problems of software, a improvement of documentary, and even new projects.
It was made in 25 Italian cities.
This San Francisco, even though it's not Italian, but there are many Italians who are helping us from the technological point of view, out of the History.
All of this reflects - we're talking about sustainability and scalability in the sight of true for sponsors of Italy, like T, where they're exposed, all the documentary, in all the codes, but they're always more, apps.
In the Italian publication, now there will be a fifth of what would be left, maybe even less.
The future is today, we dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that, financially, don't limit themselves to do hydraulic, they also enter the boat.
But it's true that the paintings are completed, sorry, I insist, this could be, for example, one of those things that would add to high-pitched version, the digital citizenship has the digital identity, the data of electronic identity, the air, and it's already functional.
And all this, the goal is to make it easier and family the interaction between the citizens, the public administration, with a simple interface, we are dreaming a little, because of work we really have so much, but it's different from this vision.
A few weeks ago, the storm.
I've spent 150 years writing an uncertainty, the world that expects us, I've asked many people to talk about what they think can happen, I've been asked to talk about simplification of the lives of all the days of the citizens, I've taken the opportunity to write an article that I want to mention you.
Some fish.
It's a desire or dream, maybe we do it, we want a country where politicians who try to understand the digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rule and not the exception.
A country where they read recognize and promote the right to innovate, to embrace it.
A country with technological skills that are also inside the State and public companies, a country where there are more public and private companies guided by 30 years than for 70 years.
Imagine, in the end, a country where working for public administration is a north, where better brains make money to work in public research centers, which are green and precisely the centers of excellence and innovation.
What brings development to the country?
That's how a dream is.
And that the components to do all this, digital, technological processes, are really many and maybe too many.
But if it's not a dream about which points are difficult, they can do things.
First to conclude.
This is my mom who belonged to the people who told me, "Who did you do it?"
And here it's due to some parts in this theater, among the other.
But at this point, it's more calm, and I couldn't explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the digital Tinder, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
And if you want information about us?
Here's our site and our social networks.
Did you know the possibility to make a wish?
One only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't go as you want.
So, what would change?
And what would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your genius, your employees?
You're afraid, you're looking at you, it's for that, because here behind you know there's.
So raise your hand those who would change something in your own body, maybe lose some kilo, or maybe win them in muscles.
Ah, well, here there's a little more, there's more freedom.
Let's raise your hand those who would change the same, the better they understand.
Of this, I was sure I would have traveled everything.
Or maybe you're the ones who would change their part.
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter) The more times, throughout my life, I asked myself this question: Let's understand if I won't change the part, and the answer was worth it because I would have a more united family, but my parents didn't separate.
In the media, I would have wanted to be better, for the pleasure of the youths.
In Liceo, I wanted to feel the most complicated teachers, they seemed to me all the hostiles, and I was reflected in music, here the great void to make in the living room.
I went to the university, I wanted to work, but I found myself with the difficulty of access to the work market, so all the first part of my life I had to fight and fight to try to understand how to change the things that didn't go well, from what others thought about me, to the great economical hands, from the interpersonal relationships, to my characteristics and my acquired until the birth.
And when did they become a psychologist?
Instead, I looked at my research to other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
These strategies, if they used in a small dose, could also take some benefits, but if, as most cases happen, were the only three maps to play in front of a crisis, not only they didn't solve anything good, but they ended up maintaining their problem.
The strategy, today, more diffused, is it?
(Laughter) Setting.
And we lament it a little bit of everything.
There's crisis, there's no work that's traffic, that's cold, that I'd have done in a different way, we lament it because there's no justice, we know many people who fall in the bottom of the window, and this paralyzes you, typnotizes and wake up to the spot.
I remember a girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything else than to get rid of when she started to talk to her, then from the girl with whom she had translated her.
So the fact that I didn't have work, the last work of the government that hadn't helped it, felt a value, a capacity, and now that the mind had completely colonized all its daily life.
But lamenting for all of us is a bit the great attempt, because with a small effort you can get a great result.
To review the rule of the victim, that was listened, comfortable, helped.
But, well, you can lament yourself at night or day, alone or with friends.
Do you have a high voice or your mind?
You can lament yourself of something already happened, or something that maybe a tomorrow could happen, you can lament yourself in tattoo, or as much more often happens, you could lament yourself in reason.
Because we all have many reasons to be able to lament.
But the truth is that for how much you will make you difficultly remember something around you.
It will change, elderly, you won't do anything else than giving more attention to what you say.
If the strategy that privileges, when things don't go as you would like, is to slow down, presume that someone is at the study of a B piano to save the legs in Bocahall.
Another very objective strategy, when things are stretched, is to impose our need.
(Laughter) At the base of this mentality, there's a growing cultural factor, based on which we learned that if something doesn't work well, it's enough to change it, can we manipulate our pleasure, what surrounds us, doesn't like us?
But from that aesthetic rule.
You feel a little further, but why never be in the suffering, take two pillars and resolve it?
Your red wife, divorce.
"I'm fresh, we all agree how many risks on the palm, your child doesn't listen to you, less."
(Laughter) It's too big to not register it, send it to the psychologist, we're here for this, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice is for this profession, to make the world around you get involved in perfection with your demands.
(Laughter) The environment inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way are the relationships of copies.
I remember one, a copy, during the collapse of which I didn't do anything else than listening to what, according to one, the other would have to change to solve the resources of their future.
Hey.
Well, of course you're to agree, but not even to prepare yourself in Chinese, which is also a classicone, and she, "No, if you don't look for me, you don't realize all the things I do for you, and so you'll see the infinite a loving arm.
That always begins with the same word: stretch.
Thank you.
Anyway.
Because we have to show all the water line of the other, we have to make them see all the problems that should be cured to reproduce our happiness that has kidnapped us.
But the truth is that if this thing is often said in a good ugly, believing us deeply.
We hardly can change something, elderly, instead of choosing the node at the base of the relationship, we think about a pair of times because we'll have a full of resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, is to make us feel like a tool to take the head and put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, there's the fear of facing the conflict that would emerge, that we should show our needs, and then what do we deal with them for the common good?
But in this way we don't even take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity, and we live in the merce of the needs of others.
I remember a young boy, a young boy, a son of separated parents, who, at the end of the first childhood, had learned to distress with great diplomacy between the children of mom and dad.
I hope I hope that when you were openly drawn in the face of one, you would have lost the love of the other, in this limited situation.
I learned important things, for example, in words.
To listen, to accept, to think about motivations among them, even distant from one from the other, but on the other hand, I've never learned to say no.
But the things they didn't go well didn't learn to say no to the relationships they were going to look for, there were any relationship condition, and, elderly, it was one of those who always had to measure, but in this way they had to finish their needs, their desires, their ambitions, they were always underwent to tell you how much.
The strategy of privileges, when things don't go like you're, is to suffer your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you, and instead of telling you all how many, I'll end up failing.
To wake up.
But in addition to their needs, or to suffocate them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say, with the means of cause, because I myself, throughout my life, have abused.
I'll tell you what happened to me.
One day, the first hospital I collaborated, sent me to call and said to me.
And there's no more place here for her.
If we like to continue the collaboration with us, we must accept a transfer.
And I tell myself a far away place, hoping, and detesitated from the most, or, above all, I would have to go there to make a job that didn't even enter a big deal with everything I had studied until then.
And then I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, trying to make them change the idea, adopting, but sending that other, and even less because I'd never had to accept a commitment that was unbearable for me.
And there I realized that, to get different results, I had to do different things.
For the first time, of course, on my legs, at that moment.
I understood that the secret, to change the others.
It's changing itself.
And if it was changed me?
But also the others would be able to follow, modify, change.
If it was a super brilliant, complete, unique psychologist, the first one wouldn't send me to travel.
If I had also done it, the thing wouldn't have taken me more than so, old, maybe I'd have been going through me before I was still hungry, but if I wasn't that person yet.
But the answer didn't go to the other's fault, but I had to introduce myself to the profound of my responsibilities.
Why things?
But they don't change.
We are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do is in the direction of choosing ourselves.
To choose you as a cause of things that are not like you want.
You choose yourself as a cause of things that don't go as you want.
This is our bubble.
But if I never find the work of the crisis, you're putting the only arts to your disposal.
Now we'll find ourselves alone and in the hands, facing something too much bigger, I want to say, "It's the crisis's fault, what do you want to do?"
But if you're part of the Earth, and you think you're perfect, that maybe there's a change mark, that then you open doors in front of you, because it defines your responsibility, the face, then decides to always learn a new language, if you read books, to acquire new skills, to consolidate those that already have, you can work on you to become unique.
Because life is who does it.
Who doesn't do it?
I got it up.
If inside the copy, things don't go well, you think it's the other to do the first step.
And maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question: What can I do today differently to make your best day?
And then things change, but they don't change, but they change because you're you who're changed.
Before going to the research of its lacks, it's in this way that you create a mental space inside which you can take care of one of the other instead of doing it.
But you're one of those people.
Those who are with everyone, who always have to say yes, one of those people I call, ask me in the end, prostitute and relationship.
It's clear that you're not only losing time, but you also lose the sense of meaning, the things you do, if you start yourself, to understand your needs, try to understand which actions you put in the field to preserve them.
So the game becomes something inside which you can become the pattern of the tail.
So, starting to work on me, considering myself a cause of the things that didn't go as I wanted, instead of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to understand them that, with my matter, there were practical tools, sometimes fast, to bring great value inside their lives.
But friends, I met with a couple of problems.
Stereotypes, prejudices, psychologist is the doctor of the matters, the psychologist is the doctor of the debts, but I had to talk to a friend, but I went to the park, but what should I do?
I had to lament myself, or possible that I didn't tell you how beautiful psychology I had to try to change their mental priority, I had to drop my dream, no, I had to learn to speak a language, which was what didn't happen, as I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more effective way, I had to listen to their needs, instead of putting mine.
It's a bit of time.
According to this direction?
I've got results for me, unimaginable.
And when I finished the collapse with my primary and its transfer, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I didn't know what to do.
I thought about it, and in the end I decided, I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as he understood him.
I'm transferred here.
I went home, I killed the computer, and I registered a video I carried on YouTube.
In which I spoke about psychology, here for the chronologist I'm talking about to undertake the anxiety, because maybe you think it's.
In the turn of a little time, my YouTube channel became the psychology putting into discussions some of the stereotypes that I mentioned before, recently a review that from 1974, I'm in 79: I divide psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best schools, in Italy, and in Italy, and what has wanted to leave me.
Because, obviously, they saw that my attempt to innovate the profession, the way to communicate it, had something sense, and in Lombardia, I was read to the presidence of the psychologist's order: dreams.
But they don't become reality because, fortunately, or because you've had that.
The theory that must have is the one that keeps moving forward, who doesn't know how it is built and needs to build.
Because the culprit should do it.
It's also so much to discuss your identity, your points of belonging to your certainties, your habits of always, here.
If there's something I learned from all this inner journey.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but also the most urgent.
It must come to our internal, ten motivations asked you a question.
If I had the chance to express a desire, one only to modify a aspect of your life that doesn't happen.
What would you change, have we talked about work, physical perspective, the current story?
Well, in fact, I'd like to leave you with a gift, or at least try it, it's a small question that was personally very useful to me.
And that's based on logic that, to get to produce big changes, we have to focus on many small actions.
What's the smallest and simplest thing?
What could you do until now, at the end of the afternoon, with the return home after this beautiful day, and that will allow you to take the first step?
To put your life in the direction?
The one you auspicize.
You can think, what is the smallest, the simplest thing you can do to put your life in the direction you have in the environment.
You see, you have your keys of the pride that you eat.
Oh, ugly, do you leave the pull, right?
But where do you put the bags?
The cinema, "Martetites" are the problems.
Ah, indeed, today I call it.
Or on your feet, what's time to change?
(Video) Life is when my mother arrives.
Do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to talk for eight minutes.
And that's it.
Well, I want to take this time by myself, here.
I had a dream.
To create a integration band.
In other words, diversity and diversity.
The percussions are so fast, so immediate.
They take the distances and unite the battles.
Are we leaving?
We're lost in seven.
If you were young, I see them, I see the Laura, the Paola, the grandmother, I saw them grow.
Our tests were the marketing.
So the night was the day of evidence, where this stadium was entered in the Andreolic music school.
We took the first bidons, we were together, the first waves together.
Then we decided to become a good mark, from there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical brands and travels: the first brands, the first brands in the pieces.
And the first satisfaction, the first encounters?
The first satisfaction for the kids, for us, for everything we were doing.
But above all, the first applause.
Unfortunately, a night of the 20th of 2012, the world came down.
In the real sense of the word.
All the cases were completely unbearable or crowned: a strong earthquake scope, collected our earths, and from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of the thousands.
We were all called this.
As I said, the houses were no longer today.
Many crossed: our proof, our place where?
Where there were all the markets, it was completely district.
And the tools were inside.
But what did we do?
I, the Sahara, Marco, Fede, Matteo, we all looked for them.
GV: You have them in doppoli, and the steps.
We were able.
Luckily, we found everything.
We're all finished inside a tender, in a tender, in the thirst of manifesto, in the end of the media.
In that tenderness, there were magnificent things.
We've seen fear sounding stronger.
We looked at ourselves in the eyes, with the Earth that was shaking, to look for a smile, a look.
And the Earth was shaking.
I'm there inside.
We built the first tools.
The scary cests.
They became houses in the bank.
The tubes that have become...
The tools built and suited with ping pong racks, to remove them made with big houses, crowned.
We were constantly working, always, there was an amazing energy.
Even if we were at a terrible moment.
The inside was born in our first protocol, we decided to put it on a real sponsor.
However, the group's components were increasing, the friends spent the word of 20 that we were, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
But we are part of the construction of the first protocol: the white.
Because it's the white man, because there were the smallest loops, the smallest loops and the white genius, at that moment, we all moved together as a loopy white.
Then, immediately after, did we do it?
Last year, we did the high school, the curve.
We became all marine.
Because we really wanted to navigate.
It's also to move for a moment of our Earth.
To breathe for a moment.
Then the year later we made a crack, this marine monster, immediately after.
50 speakers, this flying ship.
And to finish, that of this year, the sea of the Moon, the sea of the Moon.
We wanted to stop a second.
On this Moon, it's looking at the sea.
There were many things inside this tenderness, and none of us would never have thought that a tender could change life.
But we did it.
But I want to tell you something.
The minutes are finishing me.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems to me a favola.
It's 150 concerts in turn for the adventure.
The first magician's stage?
GV: The concert in the TV program at home.
Is it the lack of material?
And we really did so many.
And also to me, screaming for the videos, because this is exactly me.
It's exactly the scenery of life.
The fatigue of the sweat, but also of the freshness.
It's a lot of possibilities in the future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality?
Now I have to go back from the fruits, they expect me.
Is there still so much?
And to build.
Thank you all.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Ferradini, and in fact, I was born as a lawyer, until the moment I asked myself what happened in the last 250 years, there are 250 years, very important that changed radically our history, and that we live today.
It's about social innovation, and my question is: What is this social innovation?
And above all, our Italy, which is often so biased, is a ready country to incorporate this digital innovation, and ready to be tested at the same time of innovation.
This is the digital metaphor, we all take it to us, an object, I believe, almost everyone.
The phone is a technological solution that belongs to the Industrial Revolution.
These three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new time, that we have, in some way, strictly battled in the Internet revolution of the Internet phase in our history, and yet, it's a very evolving computer, and the computer that we're living today.
We try to understand, then, what happened in these 3 in these 250 years, that summarize the industrial revolution, the Internet revolution and the Internet soldiers, and we remember it as a Ferrovia, which is what we've studied.
It was on the school book, in fact, it wasn't just a Ferrovia.
We, at the Industrial Revolution, are huge debates, we are enormously devastated, for example, because we have the vapor motorcycle, but, for example, that has favored and has resulted much faster, the United States has started to change the modality of manufacture.
And we don't only have the motorcycle.
In vapor, we also need the scope motorcycle, because, on the other hand, it's a Toscana invention and an Italian investment.
The motorcycle has scored.
For example, we need the automobilistic industry: in fact, before the Christmas industry, because the motorcycle was a motorcycle that couldn't go from the farm, when they were able to understand.
It was a motorcycle in terms, when I couldn't understand how to get out of the scent, to realize it as a verb, and it became with the scent that developed the automobilistic industry, and everything that has come to us, but not only.
In the Industrial Revolution, we are still in debates, for example, for the phone, the phone is not only with the tool that has allowed us.
To avoid continuing to see our letters and that has speeded the migration of these letters from one part to the other of the world, always more broader than they knew.
But is it also what has allowed us, and has taught us to deposit the caves?
It's under the sea.
And yes, because then the phone couldn't try them in the sea, and then what we were doing, we interrupted everything, no, we went forward, standing on the sea.
The first cavity, to give you a storal dimension, was taken from Italy between medicine and registered the beach, not just two populations wake up in agreement, but the first cavity was there.
And we are around 1858.
But there's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know what it is, we use it, brings our voice, in 187900 subscribers to Rome, is only 1877.
Another intention, and it's the Milan Rinascente, today it's the teenager, there, a time in 1873 was built by the first electric central, the first electrical central power.
In that year, on December 30th, the scarce was lit.
A part of our history was born exactly from there.
Let's move forward, let's try to make some more significant moments, always more structural, but it begins to be something, to compose something that has never been in the first story: among the colors that at the beginning of the '50s were simply faster, the calculator, but in these 50 years of the revolution on the Internet, something happened.
There were research institutions, and above all, there were scopes of all the defense.
Those who have brought to develop subterraneal reactions, but not underground because they've taken on the ground, but they won't know because they were not known.
At some point, we decided to open these laws.
And these challenges, called ARPA, the network, became and started to be the World of Web that we know.
There was a diffused, or horizontal system, not hierarchical, extremely captured, capable of bringing information, in 1981 there were only 300 the computer connected to the Internet, in 1995 and there were 25 million, not many.
Today, it's in the orders of thousands, because we're not talking about the computers we use, but of all these intelligent systems that connect to the network to care about data, to pick up data or to work for data.
But when the mechanical strength, which was made of replaced, that was introduced by industrial revolution.
It started to include the Artificial Intelligence of computers.
And mobility.
It's that I'm essentially an industrial process that tells us that what is new, progressively, constructs what is old, because we've lived now, that we're living now, the one that's called in the Internet, we've had the time that we started to live the time that we've lived now, that we're living now, progressively destroy what is old.
I tried to accompany you.
It was 1863, when, little by little, the Italy hasn't made the Italians yet.
The Minister Mingetti, put in English finances, establishes that the 27th of the Middle Ages, is corresponded to the payment and public dependents.
And from 27 to the next months, what happened?
And at this moment, even if we don't realize it, we're introducing ministers that are producing something extraordinary: before the wealth of a family, more than a singer, was in their ability to produce good services that were necessary to their own support.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky of the stages, less risky of the elevation, it started in some way to move away from the Earth, and above all.
It has transformed the economic power to be able to produce goods and services in the power of production of one, the money.
But there's a second aspect.
Because the fridge is that it's not only that object that frees us from the emergency of going to do the spirit every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to preserve, in a massive way, a healthy way, in quantities of food.
And where does a D?
It gives us the possibility, once again, to focus on something that is not.
Immediately, the use of everyday life.
And this is the man who begins.
To live to the end of 900, these are us.
And in time, how did we say it?
And I arrived at the computer and arrived on the Internet, and then there's a figure that has characterized these years, that is an element.
That we can define how the qualificator of these years, the speed, the speed of the challenges, the speed of the movements, the speed of our movement, and we, 25 years ago, weren't fast as we are today, we today, do the speed of our thinking that is not said quality of thinking.
But we are very fast.
But until then something happened.
Typically, it's close when you look at the story, to understand the passengers from one century to the other, and sharing data that are not necessarily zero.
In 1900, 1900, 1900, 2000, when we can say that it's finished the 20th century, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two data that is significantly segregated from a time to another, 2001 and 2001.
First of all.
So the American economy started to slow down, and on the other hand, there were Torri Gemelli, and so something in balance has started to change, these balances that seemed solid, we realized that they were very fragile.
But we went forward until there was something that has slowed all the environment, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world, and the oriental world together, had never met.
There wasn't only America to have slowed, almost closed, there was also the orientation.
But there were European states that were to fail.
The Greek was already the leaves of failure, they don't talk to us, but still there.
It's changed something, but what has changed is changed, the economic paradigm we couldn't.
Not to wait for the biggest economic crisis that, in fact, was verified in 2008 and was crazy not to think about it, but how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension?
When can we do everything?
With many less people.
It was obvious that it would be dead: we were blind, we didn't know how to wait, look at these companies.
These companies are stable multinationalities, in their majority, but above all, they are all companies that are Dante after 2011.
So, what did these companies not innovate inventing something, they didn't innovate building something that was before there, but they started to do what we've always done, to buy, to travel, to learn?
Learn.
The different way, the most efficient way.
And the Italy, often denied, we try to look at the state of health and digital Italy, according to five factors: connectivity.
We're ten percentual points under the media, but honestly, we're almost close to a fast connection for 50 percent, and so much is little.
Anyway, something, according to human skills, human resources, abilities we remember it, it must be different between advanced and basic skills and basic skills, with what allow us to develop.
A third fact that we have to look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it, a third element, is the inclusion of the digital factor in productive processes.
So the business, or the industrialization of products and services, the fifth or the digitalization.
The system of public administration: we immediately have the field of some ambiguity, and we keep the only two that are important: above all, a good news for all, all the five elements that are increased, are all the five elements that are in a growth, in a growth speed at the end of two years ago.
We're aligning European countries, and this doesn't work news, on the other hand, connectivity, we've said it in ten points outside, but we're basically looking at the newspapers and see that we're growing fast, there are new operators, new competitions, we're really a little.
In fact, it was born a very profound change that is aligning us to the European standards.
There are two factors that we have to look at with great attention that will be key for our future of countries: we have two engines, not effective, far from being the small business measures, and are the skills and the inclusion of the digital in the brutal facts.
They're probably the entrepreneurial tool, the most effective to interceive the speed of change: they're agile, they're speeds, they're small, they know how to do something extraordinary that is the Made in Italy, the production of products.
Because it's pretty unique in their DNA, everyone wants it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, competences inside these realities, those multinationals that can serve.
A internal segment of the market, in an extraordinary way, generating richerness for the whole tissue that is around you, a heritage that nature, for her natural nature, and this is the first assault that we have, the first big motorcycle, we can't digitalize the crop.
But is it possible?
That tourists, visited only three cities, Venezuela, Firences, Rome, and then meet, but the richerness of these three cities don't make the wealth of our country.
And we're learning, maybe we've tried to start, but we're fast to recover, to include this heritage.
In a knowledge system that allows us to carry it and enjoy it, to make it notice, and to bring tourism not only to visit three centers, but to visit all our country, I believe that this is the great need that we can do in our Italy: Great.
(Applause)
I'd talk about it in a certain sense, and the opposite action of the word "share," because I'll talk not about sharing, but in a certain sense of the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'll talk about inequality, I'd like to start first.
With a question: According to you, in the last 15, 20 years in Brussia Pelo, we say, in the 21st century, inequalities in the world, the inequalities between the citizens of the world are increased or are decreased?
But I believe most of you will answer, "I'm increased, if you were the journalists, maybe you'll reach the precious goal, they're increased in a exponential way, and if I asked you, "What about it?"
But maybe the answer of many would be.
Also.
I asked myself these questions in the last few years.
And with the only 24th and the foundation of video, I prepared.
(Laughter) With my colleagues, a report.
In inequalities, from when they are artists, that is, financially, from 1960 to the majority of the countries in the world.
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter) The result is what you see.
This is the curve of the development of inequality, directly between the citizens of the world, as you can see, there was indeed an increase of inequalities, especially in the 80s, but from now on.
And from the end of the last century, at the end of the '90s, the compessive inequality between the citizens of the world is crowned and precipitated, now we are at the worst storage, and in Italy.
In Italy, the neighbors of inequality are quite complicated, even here we have an increase throughout the 80s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second Republic.
AC: We have a trend of inequality of growth.
And how can we read these data?
Well, a possible reading is to say, "We've traveled a collective bathroom because we continue to talk about years of argument of inequality, how much data is not supposedly in this reading."
But we could also ask ourselves another question: What if the feeling of an increase of inequalities that many of us have the same?
Let's go!
It wasn't wrong the feeling, but it was wrong the idea of inequality in which we think about.
AD: Perhaps.
We must reflect on the issue of inequality, on what we understand, for inequality, maybe the concept of inequality requires some rethink.
(Laughter) We leave temporary in suspicious this question, and we move around a century.
It's also a place: we move to Cambridge in 1928, a year before the great Church of 29: Lickens.
It was Cambridge, there's a speech in front of you.
(Laughter) In that occasion, Keynes forms two professions, a famous discourse with the economic title for our grandchildren: "The first says.
And between a century, productivity.
So, from a worker, it will be eight times the one of today, that is 1928.
And this trade, in fact, is made because if you went to take it.
There are the reconstructions of the stories of the economy.
Indeed, most of the advanced society, we have an increase of productivity in the turn of 100 years, which even of 10 to 12 times, so this teacher was also achieved a consequence, an idea, which is humanity.
In a few years, it would be found with a huge amount of free time that would have taken it to work less.
And he also said, to work everyone, and when he said less, he understood a week of 15 hours of work.
I have a three-hour work time a day.
And he saw a problem for this, because the question that was asked Keynes, but with all this free time we knew how to use it well or not.
AD: Well.
Apparently, this second teacher didn't realize it, because we all see it, that we don't all work, and it doesn't seem exactly what we work three hours a day.
I'll show you that this teacher is divided in two parts, there's one that says we'll all work, it's certainly false.
But the first part we'll work a lot less, we'll work three hours a day, we're sure it's not done anywhere, we'll see what happened in Italy.
That's it.
Keep, this trajectory represents.
But what is time fraction?
Well, if we look at this trajectory, the prophecy of Keynes is actually made, because we were at the beginning of 900 almost 40% of the time of our life, its life naturally potentially working, that is, for the 15 years, then, when we are able to compare a job.
To work, and now we look for 16% and the interesting thing is that this 16%.
It's two hours and a fourth a day, that is, the barrier of the three hours we've already screwed it in Italy.
Naturally.
Well, if this happened, there are also ears and banals.
There's another very positive reason, and other banks, if you want, often study long, our children also study for years, so even young age has been announced.
But there's a more fundamental reason why.
CR: Our quote of time?
I dedicated to work and believed.
And it's the test of occupation, that is, the number of people who work.
This is the historical series of total occupation.
It's built for this occasion and this dramatic series, because it makes you see, okay?
In the beginning of the century, in all monarchical era.
Before the Second World War, the occupation rate was even better than 70%.
AC: Today.
And we're very low, we're around 50 percent scarce, elderly.
In 1978 and except one year, the occupation rate has always been inferior to 50 percent, what does it mean?
This means that there are more people who don't work, who don't work, that is, pure consumers who don't perceive any network.
There are more workers.
But, in front of this?
That's it.
A storal one: we can also have a reaction.
But it's enthusiastic and say.
But this is progress, beauty, and modernity, things have been like that because we can allow it.
But then we see if, in the country that the problem of modernity, that is in the United States, things have been in the same way, because if this interpretation is fair, we should have happened in the United States, and then we see the confrontation.
A: Italy.
And the United States.
AC: This is the storal series of time.
It's dedicated to work in life, as you can see, in the United States, it's only up to the 30s, then it's established, and it's a lighter tendency to the increase while we believe it, but even more impressive, and the storage series of the occupation rate.
There's an increase, that small one you see below is the crisis of 29: we have a general tendency of the occupation rate in the United States at the increase, but in our case we have a situation of reduction.
Well, the occupation task.
But then, this is a pathology.
Well, it's not normal.
Okay.
There are more people who consume without producing than the people who produce.
But it's not normal that the majority of the population lives in a condition that I'll define.
A parasitary dependency, dependency, because I depend on the network of Twisia, this one can also be a family, the State.
But it's parassitary because I consume, I have the right to available without working.
I have a friend who does it.
Theater was theater, when did I find these results?
We were at the end of the eye.
And you, how would you represent this situation with an image, a situation of parasitary dependence, and you know what answered to me?
With the hypothesis, it's that light that lives on the spots of the hypothesis, but it's called buffag, some say buffaga, here it is.
If you want to have an idea of how you behave.
The bubble or the bubble on the prototype, or on the other big mammals, these birds also live on the bridges, on the bubbles, well, we have this film that will treat us for a few seconds, in which you can see.
[A.DE.]
What about these fish?
How do they live?
Speaking of the resources that the bubble provides, which are insects.
The tree means that everything that's on the edge of the bubble is not clear if the bubble is contained, that eye that can mean that it's playing, it's that it's bothered by the light, even if it's.
This is what happens in nature, but I'm not an ethologist, I do the sociologist, so the question I asked myself as a sociologist.
It's another.
But as we can define a situation of this kind, as we define a society in which there is this kind of productive consumer, the first one, there for them, said to me, "But this is the ignorant society?"
And society, gentlemen, as a feudal society in which there's a ceiling that has put in the condition of living without working.
But, naturally, it's not enough: you have to add a qualification.
Well, this is indeed a condition.
That it could be defined by ignorant society, but it's a mass society.
Audience: Yes!
Because the consumers are more than producers, in the society they smile is simple, classic, we have the sign and the serves of the globe that produce for them.
Well, in society, the clear report is a relationship of commanding and subtomission: in mass security, things are a little more complicated, gentlemen have become many.
"Yes."
The relationship between signs and producers is much more complicated: Greek Dubezon, a great psychologist anthropologist, would have defined a relationship of legacy, we see why.
KA: The relationship?
The bubble with the hypothesis is parassitism, and this is a advantage signed in green, but it's also dependence, because it depends on food that is on the sphere of the prototype.
The nurse indicates one.
A disadvantage.
Because we can't, we don't need bubble, but it's also from the point of view of producers, we have a red light, a green light, the autonomous hypothesis doesn't need the bubble.
So, not nourishing the fish that live on their spices, so the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of legacy, but a situation.
That's not fine.
Is it a situation in which?
There's a new problem of inequality, and now we get there.
This is the question I had asked about Keynes: today, maybe, is the real inequality?
And the inequality of access to work, the access to work is very asimeteric in our social system, but if inequality is access to work, we can use the tools.
In the analysis of inequality, that is to calculate an efficient concentration of genius, which is the tool with which.
And if we measure inequality, we can apply it to work: there are people who don't work, who have a job, who have two jobs.
And the position of the History, in this scale of inequality of access to work, is dramatic, the position of the History is to be penitimate in the graduation together.
And it's Turkey.
The country in which inequality reaches the maximum one simply because there is the exclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, we would probably have the palm of what the lab is.
The best situation is the one of the northwest.
With the United States, I was in the middle.
Do they miss us?
To become an Ox and normal country, seven million jobs positions.
So, how did we get to this, this is the story?
For the inequality of access to work in Italy, it's always measured by some genius, you can see something clamorous that inequality is the minimum during the monarchical age, especially under the faster.
And it's great, in the public age, especially under the second public that is the one we live in: there are 7 million jobs in more, our families.
And they would perceive 1,000 euro a month, in more, we would have 12,000 euros of income in more.
In the year, and our state would have 150 billion euros to spend as much as they cost the health and the school put together, more or less in Italy.
Audience: Yes.
It's here, concluded.
But there's one.
Audience: No.
But we have the scholarship of writing.
In the first article of the Constitution, the History is a democratic Republic based on work: we are the only country.
That has this in the first title of the Constitution, and we are the worst country together with Turkey.
The West.
That's why.
But we change things.
We believe it.
There are 7 million jobs that lack, or maybe better to cancel the article one of the Constitution.
Because, being so, things sound like a BFP.
Thank you.
