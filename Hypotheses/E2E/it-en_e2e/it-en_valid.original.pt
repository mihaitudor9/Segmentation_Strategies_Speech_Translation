In 2016, I was given a award: from the National Forum Forticing Learning, supported by the Ministry of the United States in Irlanda, from the name a little particular, they were born in Chirese.
The motivation of this award was my availability in the confrontation of the students and my ability to create less formal environments, more relaxing environments.
Let's imagine that this is a big university class.
The sun enters in class, the first ten minutes, when the students enter and get there, put my computer to explain and put a classic music.
I think this is the first step to create data environments, less forming the most reassuring, and try to maintain the attention of the students.
Unfortunately, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a method used at the end of the old age: storytelling.
At the pedagogical level, the storytelling is a method based on the use of narratives to transmit knowledge to students.
And it's precisely with this method that I'd like to start my lesson explaining to you to describe a topic about the mouth of everyone, already: artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that children tell, I'd like to start my story once.
Second World War: Regno United, Blece and Park, a northern residence of London.
There was a young trenten: Alan Turing.
Listen to Laureal King's College of Cambridge, and they get a research doctor in logic, the Princeton University in America.
In that period, the Tedes used a special and enigma.
It was a vehicle to write, the operator digitalized details, but since stuck on a paper those letters, I stuck other letters, according to a code imposed mechanically under the machine.
The texts used this mechanism to communicate with them.
Anyone would interceive this paper in front of you without any sense.
It was shouting.
Alan Turing was one of the main figures in Blece Park, the one you can see behind, able to decipher these tests written by theedes.
For this invention, we think that war is finished with two years of anticipation, saving many human quickly.
The adventure continues, after the war, to do its logical research, and it's considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
With his Turing machine, he formalizes the computer thing, even before the computer was created in practice.
In 1950, an article published on the "Manda magazine," "Computing Machine and Intelligence," where the test of Twing proposes.
The question behind the testing is a very precise: can machines think?
From here, artificial intelligence began.
Probably many of you have seen the game limit, the game game game.
I want to explain.
Let's suppose there's a person who digs the tables to the computer, who asks questions, and on the other hand of the end, a machine is an operator.
In an alternative way, the machine M and the speaker or form the answers to the person P: if the person is not able to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the operator.
This is limiting a game.
The machine must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
It must interpret the natural language, the question that comes from the person.
It must represent knowledge to form the answers.
We must think in an automatic way to form these answers.
And it must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence.
One of these is the cognitive approach: it's based on human thinking.
According to this process, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to capture thinking in the moment they are in, or we try to modify the thinking at a psychological level.
That's why artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive neural sciences and psychology.
According to this approach, the assunction that if we can really have a female representation of human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of the laws of rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
All men are mortal, sacred and mortal.
This is a deductive argument: give two premises to get rid of, a real conclusion is deduced.
From here, the deductive logic is born.
According to the approach of thinking laws, we try to build educational arguments and see them in a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational agents.
A rational agent, an entity, must take objectives, and know how to take them to end, must adapt to the environment and act in a rational way.
So TestD Turing is linked to intelligent people.
It's formulating the Turing phrase, it can have a machine to think.
We can say, we can create a machine, an artificial agent, able to think, exhibit intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence, so, is the purpose of creating artificial entities, intelligent.
Your phone is an entity.
Among the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence as psychological constructions.
Once we have more knowledge about this issue, we try to build intelligent identity and support humans, it's a cycle.
But let's see if machines can think.
I'd like to explain to you to describe the state of art of artificial intelligence, and I'd like to use five classs to classify artificial agents according to their abilities: we have subtle agents, human ones, and finally we have optimal agents.
Let's take this with some example.
The optimal agents are the agents that act better than all men and can't do better.
For example, people who used the cube of Rubik play with a four-year-old strength in the best way, play a sad.
Think that a few years ago, a young man decided to start the Rubik cube, he got it in 4.73 seconds.
A few months ago, they created an agent, a robot that was able to solve in zero.63 seconds.
We have the sovereign people who act better than all people, for example in the game of the scenes, in the game of the scarce.
But a few years ago, the Russian Scake campaign was killed by an artificial agent.
We have people who suffer humans, those who manage almost like all people, for example, in the Power Texano's game, to answer the question of the kitchen.
We have human people who act almost like all people, in cognitive activities like the crowned words or the massification.
And finally, we have subtle people who manage the worst of all people.
Exemples are the classification of objects, the recognition of caligraphy, the vocal recognition, the translation of a language to the other.
But if there's something that artificial agents, today, are not able to do, for example, is disambiguation: we're talking about the fruit, like the mum, we're talking about the mark of the body Apple.
Something that agents are not able to do is reasoning in the ideal world, in uncertainty situations.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence, for which we think we are far from overcoming the test.
Now let's see, in the future, the machines can think.
But a few years ago, in America, a thing was introduced by the name of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest experts in artificial intelligence in the world.
Imagine the time line.
Imagine a line that indicates the human intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a red line that indicates the vehicle with an exponential attitude.
This reason follows the previous environment in the wall's laws, for which computational compassion, for example, measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, radiated for two years and in four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to make this computer complexity to reveal the human brain.
I didn't see anything.
In 2020 we would have access to 1,000 dolls to this computer capacity.
In 2025, secondary and crossed, I'll never be able to get rid of our brain in a precise way.
Finally, in 2029, machines will spend the test and will overcome the test.
And then, in 2045, and the index, the moment in which the machines will follow the intelligence of the machines will follow an exponential environment that will radically change human intelligence.
In his article, published on the "Mind" magazine, Turing didn't only proposed his test, but it also proposes new objections against its same test.
These objections are us against artificial intelligence.
A few years ago, I was a student at the University of Varese, followed a path of episode, deontology and ethics of computer science, had such a Gaithan professor, Aur√©lio Lanzerone.
Unfortunately, a few years ago.
One of the compounds we had to move was to propose a decade obedience against the tweet test against artificial intelligence.
I was the only one that proposed a decade formulated, mathematical communication, ethical and human stupidity.
But I want to describe it in simple terminals.
Let's suppose to take the intelligence of all people, to put the seed.
It's the symbol of summer to the minister side of equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
We get an intelligence equality.
But in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we've been transfering our intelligence inside a machine, and this becomes more intelligent than us, it's also true that we've left the machine to become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story, let me go to the initial question: can machines think?
I'd like to leave you with a open question: really without letting them think?
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
(Applause) How many of you today have taken pictures?
Thank you.
Okay, this gives me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in the bathroom.
It saves everyone, it's called Irenealison, it's a journalist who takes care of photography.
I'm the creative director of a study that takes care of photography, and I'm a person who has so many photos with their phone, which doesn't do absolutely me in a photographer.
I've spent the last three years - this is, I've been immersed between my maps - to take care of a liquid matter, the MOPAI photographer, which is its limits, its contradictions, its potentialities, its impact on the market, its projectal and self-related use.
But what sense can we have to try to understand such a contemporary contemporary that changes while we're here to discuss?
This is just one of the questions I asked myself in these three years and that interests me to share with you this afternoon.
But there are many others: in which way the photographer changes the processes through which we communicate?
We can consider the photographer a new language in order to influence theesthetics of the vision that forms of compassion.
The technical consciousness that is in the production of a scenario, from a professional photographer, still makes the difference regarding the simple gesture of a pulseer on a smartphone.
And how does photography change the forms and the structure of professional photography?
To find answers to these questions, I tried to open a confrontation with photos, rescuers, criticisms, theories that deserve the photographer had the way to develop experiences and reflections.
The professional photographers, instead, that for the first ten years, have embraced the challenge of this new means, I asked them to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the successes, of their images, through the cell phone.
To find answers around me, I came to New York.
Ask from the photo editor of New York Times Megers, in Cathyan, in Berlino, in the seed of AIM, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock, in Parigi, in the room of Parifotto, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world.
To enter those places where photography is distributed, it's based on contents, and understand how the photographer changes these engratulations.
To find answers, I tried to look beyond the surface of the great common places of the contemporary.
For example, "Selfie" to imput, simply, to a global narcissistic delirium.
And to connect with some psychologists have sustained with the discourse of body dismorphism.
And to remember even correlated as some sociologists have written with the occupational basis of the generation of the millennials.
Or you can't be seen as a health and affirmation of yourself, as an identical stadium, like a subversive reappropriation of your own image, as a feminist visualist visualist, like "Kitard Ben" or "The Aschor Lagger."
The "finto-pintage" aesthetic that has segregated and still segregated our mobile vision, this is my cane, Zazi, designed by my photographic experiments, is simply the result of a world's world's worldwide, or as it has sustained the social and historical vision, even economical.
Fotography, I believe, isn't the territory of answers, it's the territory of interpretations, and of this phenomenon I've tried to give a map, if not to find the route, at least to understand what we are.
How are we?
The story of the Mobile photography is short, but in a few years, or in a lot of millions and millions of people, a new code that exceeds every linguistic barrier, used daily to communicate, to manifest themselves, to feed a constant flow of images that involves an angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collective world, if you want, that has impressive numbers.
Every two minutes, today, we take more images of how many Americans have taken in the burden of the year 20th century.
More than 350 million of these images are carried every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production and the diffusion of images, of activities that until a few years ago looked at a research of professionals, a form of social interaction, a channel of projection of our private sphere in the public dimension, in which we define ourselves because we produce images.
And if the photographer is a new language, then it's the mother's family, the coppy, they're always more fascinating, and here actors are unstablished points in a universe in movement, sponsored by the thousands of messages that affect them daily.
The use of the photographer looks like the most natural expression, a liquid vision that is composed of constantly based on the instant gratification of our need of sharing.
But in a world where each one, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone, which is the professional photographer.
The difference goes through accidental and conscious photographs.
On the one hand, the facility of using the cell phone camera transformed the photography of mixing professionals, the universal language, taking account the process of democratization of photography, started with the era Kodak and arrived until the iPhone.
On the other hand, the use of the cell phone as a reference tool offered to the professional photographers, new possibilities in approach to the stories, to the contents, to the subjects.
Now, on one hand, the opening to all of us, of a dialogue channel, with a potentially global audience, has moved the professional photographer of their exclusive void as a producer of images, has put me in crisis the social function, the economic position.
We can think of the rule that has had the photographer and social network in the first Arab Spring, showing that it's a powerful tool to orient public opinion and a capture of information difficultly controlled by the regions.
This is an image of Cairo Pensiti, a show that the Folfang of SN has dedicated to the rule of the photographer Mobile in the first Arabic.
But on the other hand, try to think that the possibility of direct interaction through the web, through Instagram, between the photographer and the audience, has liberated the photographer from the past for the hands of the editor.
I've liberated it from the impossibility of reaching limited destinies, and it has allowed them to directly put themselves in the use of the nails, vehicles of information, megazes, daily, galleries, of access and limited resources, if not through traditional channels, like this.
For example, particularly interesting, the offer is the magazine magazine, the reality in journalism, in 2012, with the cover, I've been sending you to five photos, the beliefs to enter their account and put directly in real time through the body mechanism after this experiment.
And if it's true that in the Disney, "Sciat," we photograph compulsively, and also that in this same era, new paths of universal heritage of the family's photography at the time of the photographer took care of our images.
Every photovoltaic, through an opening to all the users in Instagram, is the roof of a global comer we were in, in which to read, to control the evolution of photography and society in the 90s.
Nevertheless, new paths of curatory selection, like 14 to500 Bilfotographers, created by two Italian photographers, Giulio Napolitan and George Posulic, through a job of scalp in the highest and narrative accounts around a topic.
But then they are the photographers, in the last years, have operated this tool with a great authority awareness.
I'm photos like Michael Cristophe Brown, Benjamin Louis, Orona Vib, who have used and use the smartphone of conflict, showing how the agility and the description of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of depth.
It's an eternal cup that belongs to a simple smartphone has explored new paths for Newsmaking, creating a well-being platform to put in touch the American soldiers in the south of Afghanistan with their families, and to create a motor of information from the front of the first hand.
Bread Mengin, who used it for sport photography, exclusive territory of photographers with hyper-performant appearances, and made a vehicle of intimate narration and minimal narration on the best League of Baycebol.
Research Cirnandt, who enjoyed discretion and manner for photography street, creating a very personalistic aesthetics.
I'll tell you that he made a small denouncement, going back to the American community of Brooklyn, and creating a community waiting for the parts around his job.
Let's admit that it uses it daily to build its family album, putting a reflection on how Instagram changes the facts of our privacy, and the way we build and preserve our visual memory.
Peter of Campo, who, through the African Countain, has shown how the photographer, far from limiting himself to generate visual cliches, could also be used to discuss the Western stereotypes on the crisis and the famine.
These are Luigi who interpreted the Omer's history with the cell phone, telling in the AI series, one of the oldest heritage in the history of the West, with the new vision tool.
Like Anastasia Taylor Linde, who photographed the manifestants in Piazza, who, during the protests of Mai-Dan, with a beautiful poetry abroad, and contemporary scholarship.
Well, what do these photographs know how to do?
To tell, going to the outskirts of action, or looking for personalized tags on the event.
To avoid more than recording, creating images that are never straightened to reality, but that are born from a profound interaction between photography and context, between photographer and subject.
Contaminating creatively the codes of the storytelling, designing in a big media, thinking and performing their own content to be broadcast on different platforms and reaching different audiences.
The network using the connections in an innovative way.
Putting on the authoritarian exercise for its point of view on the world, and in the quality of loneliness, articulated in a coherent way, can distinguish themselves from the visible rumor of the bottom that offers us the eyes.
All of this, I believe, makes the difference between a photograph that is, in fact, its bullying, reproduction, its self-reference and sharing, and a photograph that can still be a cultural metaphor.
Thank you all.
(Applause)
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
What we believe is to be silence, in fact, are 50 axes of electric running.
Fifty-thirds that are immediately entered in our lives, waking up from the illusion that silence exists.
I don't exist to myself.
So also in this room, those providers, these seeds, and put a frequency of 50 ERS.
So, you imagine, no, you go home after a work day, really stressful, eat with your partner, with your partner, except and then you'll get into the bubble of your bed camera and think you're alone.
But no, there's always her, this frequency of 50 Hers, that I simply increased volume, because it's imperceptible in our cases, in our lives, but it's more or less this sound.
Now, we have a positive aspect, or better, part of the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist.
But we have a positive aspect: we're never alone, that is, this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Very good, pregnant.
And if we look at it as a drawing, this frequency of 50 times is nothing more than a sound wave, a sound wave with a beautiful rich spectrum, with which we can make music.
And then I asked myself, "But why?
Why do we have it like that?
Why not make us music?
So, I'm a composer of sound column, an artist, I'm now, or a little particular, because I'm complicated life deciding to make music alone and exclusively through rumor.
My parents divorced when I was a child, and I know you think this is the classic story in Strappalacre.
But no, it was my life's revelation.
Because in the loneliness of those days, in the weight of the void of that house, I started to make music with everything I surrounded you.
So every complement from the network was no longer a classic complement of the network: we were immobile, alive, but it becomes my musical tool.
With an army among the other of my mom, that every roof didn't find the bugs.
On the other hand, Macciao, I'm looking at the streaming, this is a great thank you.
(Applause) Of course, I say, at some point, I tried to become a normal person, trying to say, "I've tried because I started studying it, piano."
Then I liked Woody Allen, so I started to stop Clarinetto.
The problem is I really liked Arenzo Arvor, who wrote a beautiful song in Bigoa, was coming like this the first years of study in Genova.
I also dropped the clarine.
It's good to not go easy to illusion my classmates.
But why did I abandon all this?
Why did I study and escape from that notation so rigid?
Because there's more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more sponsors in a rumor.
And I like to paragonate it to the problems of life.
All of us have attacked a rumor, a failure, something that made us think, but I'm sure that that that that rumor made us grow much more than a smile.
So, my mission, until I'm a child, is to transform a failure, a rumor in music, and to harmonize everything around me.
Of course, I would have been able, I say, to make a beautiful turning point, Gino Paoli, and everything would be concluded, but no.
I was complicated in this way life.
What is sound?
But above all, what is the study?
So, the study is one of the most difficult senses to understand, but also the most immediate, the easiest, the most powerful, to transmit an emotion.
Our internal eye, the protein of the oceans, our team, reaches the maximum functionality around the fifth week of gestation: the fifth week of gesture.
This means that we started to listen, even before talking, we started to listen even before seeing.
And this is not a case, because the fact must be ready to what the hospital in life, once born, must be ready to the Nora texture.
It must be afraid, it must be ready.
So, in a case, if the mother, during the pregnancy, listened to Pancroco British, didn't have to stupid if the child, once born, will be listening, for example, Shakespeare.
So, "future mum," I'll tell you, and it's a richness that I personally make you attention to the musical choice.
Attention to the trap, more than another, OK?
(Applause) But what is sound?
The sound is what we are surrounded, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what, in our lives, is completely scared: you don't see, you don't touch, but the colony is time for every day.
Richigi with our partner, the mother who screams us, because the mom screams us anyway.
All of this is the sound colony of our days.
Of course, the visual is much easier: we know it.
The visual is when we enter the assistant's hair and say, "It's smaller than how I imagined them."
But what's more small than that?
It's smaller than the man of Milan.
More small than San Pietro.
Take your house, maybe?
It's understood the same as when a person sees me in the video, or on the stage, and then I tell myself, "I imagined you higher."
Well, of course.
Because it's lower, it would be really impossible.
So, starting from this budget, the visual is what allows us to imagine, but the sound, the study, is what allows us to dream.
Let's imagine our lives, right?
Would I like to genuine your ability to observe?
We're in vacation, we're in the sea, not in case.
And we started to take pictures of our feet, in the wise, then the reader, then in another perspective.
Because it's a photo from low, you don't do it, but we also do this.
Then there's a positive time, so we call a drone to take a picture of the drunk, on top of the side, then it's 360.
Attention, then the scene came: there's the doll, no, not eating the doll, because I have to take a lot of photos, well, I have a soccer blog.
It's not true, but I have a soccer blog that talks about food, kilometers zero, more or less 20 kilometers - I don't know, I've lost the story - but it's multicultural, multisensorial, but many, so many socks, who had at some point, who, if, soccer.
No one eating doll.
We photograph it, we look at it, we make many videos, but we never stop listening.
We never stop listening, but not even a person we know.
And I teach you a trick: when you fight with someone, the best moment to know the person is to stay in silence.
The silence that, among the other, doesn't exist: listen, get hurt and listen.
Like in this moment.
So, today I'd like to bring you with me.
I'd like to take you with me, going around the world, genuinating your perception of listening.
And I'd like to start by telling you the dream of my life, the dream of my life that is born from the listening of myself.
For the first time, the listening of myself.
It was 2013, I wanted to run away from the History.
A series of failures, problems, how much more?
Because then they turned into harmony, but I think I'm going to look for a very far place from the History.
So, I decided to choose a city on the Atlantic.
There was the plant, yes, it's true, there was still so many.
And there was one of the largest cities, culturally, artistic, and really far from me: Shanghai.
I decided to participate in a competition, I came to an artistic residence and started the most beautiful years of my life, for the simple fact that for the first time I was listening to myself.
I didn't have money, I had so much fear, I had an idea, but I was the only one to believe us.
And it was the one that would have listened to the sounds of the whole world, of all cities in the world, creating for each sound a sound colony of every city, calling this project "Sound of Offsity."
And everything is really part of the city's disguise.
Cities are a great musical tool.
To wake up this musical tool, you can enter the last of the cities.
And I'd like to take you to this moment to Shanghai, where for 48 hours, I didn't stop, I registered his purposes of the city, and I created a sound colony.
So, at this moment, I want to sound: Shanghai.
(Video) (English) I'm a writer, I'm a writer, I'm a writer, I'm a baby, I'm a baby, I'm ... (Applause) (Cheers) Thank you very much.
You were still focused on the visual, and this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test.
You were all connected to the visible.
Now, there's a city that's sure, you've photographed in every way, and you've asked yourself more than once, but that smoke that comes to the tombs that are done.
At the bridge of Brooklyn, can you sound?
Yes, the bridge's bridge is an exceptional that is located completely in leg.
And I want to add it to the top.
(Music) (Music) (Applause) I see the camp that is really touched on my side, and it's something important to say.
It's not magical because, on the other hand of the world, beautiful, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because it's on the other hand.
It's magical because under our eyes every day.
Maybe many of you know a pair of places in this picture.
The rule of deaf people is 48 hours without sleeping around a city, losing themselves in the same city.
And I knew Genova.
I knew Genova because there were many times.
I've evolvedly captured many times.
I've never heard it so profoundly.
And listening to it, in this way, I can tell you that it's between my favorite cities.
That's it, I'll give you the applause.
(Applause) That's it, I started to record the first sounds.
And the first sounds were given by these children, that in this tube of iron, an old man, gave me this audio camp.
And I'll make you feel, before the Greek camp, and then, that's worked.
(Music) Now, what's the lab?
Then I left to the aircraft.
(Audience) Great.
And I like a bit - I've always done it - that I'm not normal, I've never been - I've attacked this beautiful, and it has restricted me a very low frequency that has become a synthesiser.
Hello.
I'm in the lab.
Of course, Genova is Mordandis.
Well, it wasn't a battle.
This is a serious thing.
In every way, the writing, which you see constantly in the pity of Ferrari, is not just a writer, for me it's a great musical tool, and it helped me to support the bit of this sound, and it's more or less like that.
The last sound, after I really want to dream about Genova, is the one of all the boats of the port that we are used to look above.
A perception that is opposed to the view, and so I created this microphone, I immersed it by 48 hours inside Genova's port, and I found a sound of a track that gave me a particular frequency that became melody.
And when it became melody, it's because putting it in loop is transformed into what the important voice of the colony is gold.
This is his rocker.
It's true, beautiful.
Now, I'd like to make you feel a genius, but I've come to this point.
No, here's Genova as a sound.
(Applause) OK, now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
Almost the sound of our passions, in my and your own.
And for how many people will tell you that they're rumors, they're stuck, out of time, you really want to listen to them.
And I invite you to listen.
Thank you.
(Applause)
How is it said Guybek in Italian?
But, generally, you use restitution, it's not perfect, but the idea's help.
To generate the idea of the restitution linked to monetary institution, to the benefit.
Many times, the restitution is linked to reproduce what you did, what you learned.
And passing from those who say, "It doesn't work anything," then in Italy it doesn't work anything in this country, we try it.
So the next 18 minutes, I shared some examples of this story.
Going from the end of the '90s, in 1999, precisely, this is my son's genius, to Redesio, next to Segrate.
In the same year, my monkey organized the funds collection to pay the asylum material.
I had a very heavy activity made with many parents, some of them said, "No, why should we help?
I had to think about the common state, but most of them had these extraordinary effort to help the asylum to help the community.
I collected a million 200,000 readers, because they don't remember 600 euros, and it was one of the efforts of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later, we transferred the United States, and this is still similar, the same similar school for a close school.
This is the biggest child.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we realize that it's a totally extraordinary reality.
For the issue of the gameback of the restitution, it's very normal.
So the extraordinary effort of an Italian genital is ordinary for all that society.
Not that the American society is perfect, so much: I said this, the concept of restitution, I've had fortune, I reproduce, I help the school, I help the university, I help the museum, the theatre, there are all the communities, financially, live of volunteer restitution.
There's no volunteer, there's a phenomenon and a positive circle, and there are also the mechanisms, there's fishing lucidity, there are processes.
A city based on this.
I'm ten years old.
Some of you may have known it, this is the south's launch of the famous Obamaker, who says, "System is the moment."
The ramps are attempting us very actively to ask ourselves if the system is given to a moment.
Bama lances the famous bank, and there was an incredible technological debate.
Technological launch has been 600 million dollar, so don't worry about these things, they don't happen only in Italy, they build a site that doesn't work.
It's a lot of millions of contacts, and this is the standard answer I received.
In short, criticizing not finishing for a few days, but then someone stopped criticizing and it's enough to do it.
To be able to criticize that it's easy and normal to try to do and help that it's difficult to extraordinary for us, it's not a common thing.
This is Time Magazine's coverage, which refers to the experts of technologies that have been sent by Google and other companies, they've been offered, and I agree with the Bianca house, I wouldn't have ripped up, I've been in a few weeks, I'm surely interested in this.
And the extraordinary effort, and not the ordinary, I've seen that I've finished at the Time Magers' discovery, was very interesting, and it's what I want to explain from what was spinning.
I've spilled by people who haven't learned a lot in their lives.
They had this validation, this bag, and they decided to reproduce the experiences that had filled their lives.
The experiences that, in this case, look at the ability to manage big technological systems, complex, scalable, repetible processes, and make them again possible and unbearable.
It creates a replicable system, which is the USA.
From this effort, a replicable system was born, what we hope to do with us.
I want to talk about the word model, because one also learns about models.
What were the waves of our lives that inspired us and taught us?
Those who have taught you perseverance, the desire to never move, to continue to insist, energy, empathy.
So these are the models that are part of this bag that we have to use, we want to reproduce.
As it has obviously played not only what we said until now, but also the Italy factor.
At the age of 20, the idea of helping was also because I'm Italian and I wanted to do it.
Two hours of risk, you have to do or not, there's no attempt.
Maybe the Italian lesson is to do, not only to criticize.
A few years later, we are five against San Francisco, and the Visica Avenue, to Silicon Valley, to make the necessity of the transformation in general.
It's something that's discarded a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of processes and digital transformation of the public administration.
He asks me, "Why don't you come to help us in Italy for a couple of years, I think about it, I think about it, the pavement with my wife, Monica, I talk to my genius, Jazz Beesos?
To have the brief, I decided to apply a choice methodology, so I said, "Don't regret," of not thinking.
After a few years, I think I've tried and I haven't managed, or I think I've never tried it.
The choice was made, and so it goes to the Rome for two years, in the middle of Amazon.
Who does it do it?
Mallia, Amazon, a robot.
It's not quite bad.
But do you have something underwater?
These are only many phrases, I must say that we've also received so much support, so at this moment we're focusing on this part, but there was a positive part.
I was mentally preparing the skeleton and the bureaucracy.
People ask me, "But do you expect this bubble?"
And yes, I didn't expect it, of course.
I'm a scientist, I don't often have the cinism that characterizes you a certain mentality, I'll never do it, of course, because you have the rights.
I've heard many of this kind.
This country, in fact, lacks a lot the sense of common good, of doing things because you think of helping, of improving a situation not only because it's not interested.
And here's it: for the days of you, this is a commission, for the most elderly you recognize it, as a black comistry.
I say this because the beautiful title, my movies, I've been arrested immediately at the beginning of extraordinary commission, is simply because it's their rule that allowed me to be able to take people from the public administration.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is, as the systems from inside don't become, we want to try to transform them with people who come from outside, where the fact that they don't know the administration public is a asset, and they don't have a flag, it's a advantage.
So, financially, we created a small team: I want it to be a small team, I've read 25 people, a large world, but it's also too small, of technological experts, around 80 percent, the 20% inspired by making legal, legal, governative, communication.
As you can see, the post I had done by myself, I started this adventure.
I said, "Why don't we write what I think will happen?"
In this way, we want to attract talents.
The talents you live in Italy, or that you want to make us temporary, have a compensation, probably very well inferior to what you see, how I convince you.
So I put myself in the idea, but how do I convince someone to do the same thing I'm doing?
On the other hand, maybe some of you recognize it.
This photography of the name of Bella, in the '47s, has accumulated all over the world.
Thanks to the children of the phone, in all the United States, in this massive sport of investment of infrastructure, we created the vision that the operating system of the country is a series of fundamental components that can build simpler services for citizens, the public administration and companies, through innovative products.
It's a very beautiful vision, in the documentary, it's "lacrime and blood."
I continued in my place, the soccer field.
Look at the American soccer if I don't make mistakes.
And I continued, we will also have many rules complicated, sometimes incomprehensible, it's a easy prediction.
We should learn to manage with intelligence and bureaucracy, many of you will say, "Don't understand how public administration works," they've already tried us in many, they've failed in Italy, it doesn't work like that.
And we'll get many criticisms.
Some comments will be useful, others will be cinemas and prejudices.
The criticisms of the first type will make people who really want to offer their contribution, and we've found many.
The second type of color they want to defend the state of the team is that they always see the bubble in the void, or that, simply, they've been drawn to the helpless.
And this is our problem: to teach things that don't work.
Remember this image: first, men and women on the cover of Time Magazin.
That's it.
So, despite looking for the most possible people to do with the eye, I received about three,000 questions, that certainly, at least a hundred of them decisively qualified.
We've used digital tours for ecologists, an application called Jazz, we have it in the middle of the government, it's made a mathematical test, a third of colors in the technological part.
The team has reached the mass of CRP, so there are seven people in the genius, now we are a little more entertaining.
And it immediately started to operate, what do we do?
In fact, we take care of Draulica.
These are the tubes of the administration public, some of them to do a lot about connecting, because the big problem is that the systems, the applications, anything that should be interconnected, and asylum, don't connect.
And I'm not only talking about machine-machine, I'm also talking about people who don't want to explore their own data, their own software, their own applications.
So it's introduced to the concept, to explain it, and in years to implement it, to connectivity, to interruptability.
And sponsor the code of the public administration, the emergency of the software, of course.
And to do so many projects activities.
So, so much hydraulic activity.
But we can't also be pictures.
To make the services of the beach, in time, you have to make them better, to make them better, to make them easier.
All these things are done in parallel, but without the tubes you can't do the chest.
After a few months, in the magic of 2017 we wrote the piano, the administration public, we did it together with the ages of other people who helped us.
What's particularly the trendal piano for the transformation of the public administration?
In other words, there's one thing that exists.
Two are written in a clear, technological way, but also in the process.
For the first time, it was assessed and sponsorized by the government.
Polo Gentilonia has affected the decrease of the present as a minister, the digital staff is a priority of the government.
In other words, it requires a team game to simplify public administration, the life of the citizen.
The quality of the piano is once a year, for those planes can't be static, especially in technology.
And it's appreciated to administrations.
What is this?
This is the only way to make the pieces in Italy, in the public administration, the regulation requires the technical rules and connections from other norms to other rules, and at some point the technological rules are quite uncomfortable.
Unfortunately, we can't abolish these things, but we can do other things in parallel.
So the trendal piano is put on the githab, the technology of you understand it, and put it in shape, where we can talk to the administrators, the feedback, the documentary on the rhythm of Ox in a way that public administration and software can improve it.
We dedicate ourselves to this particular moment, and this is always a part of the piano to abilities.
These are the big platforms.
They are digital payments, they are those things that ability to ignore all the activities of the public administration, more there will be.
Digital program is one: electronic cards, electronic letter, which is a platform.
Identity to digitalize a traveling platform.
The greatest project we've followed is called the national and resilient population, and I'm banalizing technologically all the data of you, citizens, who are at 8,000 Italian, in the only Database, where data is talked between them, especially synchronized, and talk to the rest of applications and administration.
When I get transferred from one common to the other, I must, in the beginning of the thing I've been managing manually, then I have to go to the school, to the motorization, to all those places, I have to say, all those things I've already had to know.
I'm solving the technological solution, then I'll do so much about processes.
A week ago, we made a series Akaton, where 800 software educators have worked on the application of the Tampians, they were used in 96 interventions, and even new projects.
It's done in 25 Italian cities, but there are also many Italians who are helping us from the technological point of view, out of the History.
All of this reflects - we're talking about sustainability and scalability in the sight of old and spontaneous levels, like T, where they're exposed to all the documentary of all the coders, but they're always more applied to the Italian publication.
Now there will be a fifth of what would be left, maybe even less.
The future is today.
Let's dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that normally don't limit themselves to do hydraulic, they also enter the boat.
But it serves that the paintings are completed, sorry, I insist.
This can be, for example, one of those things that would embrace the alsa biodiversity, the alpha mare is already functional, and all this is the purpose of making it easier to family the interaction between the citizens and the public administration, with a simple interface.
We're dreaming a little, because of work we'll really do so much, but it's different from this vision.
A few weeks ago, the storm has completed 150 years, has written an uncertainty, the world that expects us.
I asked many people to talk about what they think can happen.
I asked you to talk about simplification of the lives of every day of the citizens.
I've taken the opportunity to write an article that I want to tell you some fish.
It's a desire or dream, maybe we do it, we want a country where politicians who try to understand the digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rule and not the exception.
A country where they read recognize and promote the right to innovate, to embrace it.
A country where technological skills are also inside the state and public companies.
A country where there are more public companies and private, guided by 30 years than 70 years.
Imagine until a country where working for the public administration is or not.
There are better brains to work in public research centers, that are green and precisely the centers of excellence and innovation that take development to the country.
It's true that if a dream is that the components to do all this, digital, technological processes, are really many and maybe too many, but if it's not a dream about which pointing is difficult, they can do things.
First of all, this is my mother who belonged to the people who told me, "Dad, do it.
(Laughter) And here it serves somewhere in this theater, among the other.
But at this point, it's more calm.
I couldn't explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the digital Tinet, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
That's it.
And if you want information about us, our site is our social media.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Did you know the possibility to make a desire, one only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't go like you would like?
What would you change?
Please raise your hand if you would change your job, your genius, your employees.
You're afraid, you're looking at you, it's for that, huh?
Because what's the introduction there?
But raise your hand those who will change their own body.
Maybe losing some kilos, or maybe winning them in muscles?
Being, here there's a little more, there's more freedom.
Please raise your hand those who would change countless.
It's better, it's understood.
On this, I was sure I would have traveled it all.
Maybe you're the ones who would change partner.
(Laughter) More times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
Let's not change the parts.
The answer was varied because at the elementary, I would have wanted to have a more united family, but the doctors weren't separated, at the lights I wanted to be more beautiful.
So the great voices to make the test come out.
I went to the university, I wanted to work, but I met the difficulty of access to the job market.
So, all the first part of my life, I started fighting and fighting to try to understand how to change the things that didn't go well, from what others thought about me, to the great economical fears, from the interpersonal relationships, to my characteristics and acquired until the birth.
When I became a psychologist, I also put this research to other people, and I realized that they, like me, used three strategies mainly.
These strategies, if used in small doses, could also take some benefits.
But if, as most cases happen, they were the only three maps to play in front of a crisis, not only they didn't solve anything, but they ended up maintaining their problem.
The strategy, today, more broadcast, is to wake up.
We lie a little bit of everything, there's crisis, there's no work, there's traffic, it's cold, that I'd have done in a different way.
We eat it because there's no justice.
There are many people who fall in the bottle of the window.
And the problem is that if it's a mental space, this paralyzes you, it's notice and welcomes you to the eye.
I remember a girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything else than when I started talking to when I stopped going home.
I started lamenting the excitement that had left it, then the girl with whom he had translated it, so the fact that he didn't have work, the last work of the government that hadn't helped it.
It felt like having value, ability.
And here's where the mind had completely colonized all its daily life.
To wake up for all of us, it's a bit the great attempt, because with a small effort you can get a great result: to review the void of the victim that is listened, comfortable, helped.
Look, you can lament yourself at night or day, alone or with friends, at a high voice or at your mind.
Have you ever thought of something that could happen, or something that might happen tomorrow?
You can lament yourself at the roof, or as much more often happens, you can lament yourself in the right.
Because we all have many reasons to be able to grow.
But the truth is that for how much you will make you hardly remember something around you will change.
Listen, don't do anything else than giving more attention to what you say.
It's the strategy that for the villages, when things don't go as you'd like, is to slow down, to assume that someone is at the study of a B piano to save the skin.
He searches the magnifying glass.
Another very objective strategy, when things are stretched, is to get involved.
To impose our need.
The base of this mentality is a growing cultural fact that we learned that if something doesn't work well, it's enough to change it.
We can't manipulate our pleasure, what surrounds us.
Do you like the ship?
From the aesthetic circle.
And you feel a little judge.
But why never be in suffering?
We take two pillars and we solve it easy.
Are you ready?
Forget it!
Is there fresh?
Let's take all the risks to the palm.
I don't listen to you.
Please.
Is it too big not to register it?
If we send it from the psychologist, we're here for this, on the other hand.
My vocation, the certainty for this, this profession, to make the world around you.
You take the perfection with your demands.
The context, inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way, are the relationships of coppy.
I remember one, a copy, during the collapse of which I didn't do anything else than listening to what, according to one, the other would have to change to solve the resources of their future.
Yes, but of course you're to agree, but not even to take you to the Chinese, which is also a classicist.
I said, "No, if you never try to be for that, and you don't know, you don't realize all the things I do for you, and she, no, if you don't listen to me, otherwise you'll always start with the same word, stretched, you.
Because we have to show all the equation line of the other, we have to make them see all the problems that should be cured to reproduce our happiness that has kidnapped us.
But the truth is that if this thing is often in a good ugly, believing deeply, we can hardly change something.
Let's move forward, instead of choosing the node at the base of the relationship, let's end up irrigidating them to heal them.
The strategy that privileges, when things don't go as you want, is to impose your need and wait for others to modify the consequence, think about a pair of times, because it will have a full life of resistance, full of hostility.
The third strategy: when things go in a way that we don't like, is to make sure there is no way.
A building takes the head and put it under the ground.
The base of this dynamic, often, is the fear of facing the conflict that would emerge, that we should show our needs.
So, what do we do?
We suffer for the common good.
But in this way, we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity.
And we live in the market, we need others.
I remember a young boy, young and young man, a young boy, a son of separated parents, who, at the end of the first childhood, had learned to distress with great diplomacy between the tips of mom and dad, often spinning from the fear of one, would have lost the love of the other.
In this limited situation, I learned important things.
For example, I learned to listen, to accept, to think about motivations among them, even distant from one from the other.
But the other hand, I've never learned to say no to the things that didn't go well.
So I learned to say no to the relationships they were going to look for it, there was any relationship condition, and elderly, it was one of those who always had to do all the media costs.
But in this way, they had to end their needs, their wishes and ambitions.
They were always underwater the fear of facing the conflict and the need to tell all how many.
It's the strategy that privileges, when things don't go like you're, is to suffer your needs, first or then your body will start to talk to you.
And instead of contenting all the numbers, I'll end up failing.
To wake up, to impose your needs or to suffocate them, there are three limiting strategies.
I can say it with the means of cause, because I myself, throughout my life, have abused.
I'll tell you what happened to me.
One day, the first hospital in which I collaborated sent me to call and said to me, "But Zuccelli, here for her, there's no more place.
If I like to continue the collapse with us, I must accept a transfer and I tell myself a far away place, lost, detesitated by the most.
In addition, I would have to go there to make a job that wasn't even a big deal with everything I had studied until then.
I've felt dying, OK.
But it didn't make sense to lament myself, to try to make them change the idea, to adopt, but to send that other, and even less because I'd never had to accept a commitment that for me was unbearable.
I realized that to get different results I had to do different things.
The first time, of course, on my legs, at that moment, I realized that the secret, to change others, is to change ourselves.
And if I changed, the others would also be able to modify, change.
If it was a super brilliant, complete, unique psychologist, the first one wouldn't send me to travel.
And if I had also done it, things wouldn't take me more than that.
Let's see, maybe it's been me before I was the only one in Cias.
But if I wasn't that person, the answer didn't go to the other's fault, but I had to introduce myself to the profound of my responsibilities.
Because things don't change.
We are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do is in the direction of choosing ourselves.
You choose yourself as a cause of things that don't go as you want.
This is our bias.
If I never find the work of the crisis, you're putting the only arms to your disposal.
Now we'll find ourselves alone, in the hands, to face something too much bigger.
In other words, it's the crisis, what do you want to do?
If you're part of you, and you think you're perfect, that maybe there's a change margin, that you can improve, then you open yourself in front of you.
Because it becomes your responsibility, the face, then decides to always learn a new language, if reading books, attending courses to acquire new skills, consolidate those that already have, you can work on you to become unique.
Because life is those who do it.
He doesn't do it, he suffers it.
If inside the copy, things don't go well, you think it's the other to do the first step, you're sending them a message of inequality, and you're going away.
If, instead, leave you, and maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question: What can I do today differently to make your best day, then things change?
They don't change, but they change because you're you who're changed.
If he sent the research of his lacks, now he's looking for his needs.
And then I try to operate to be able to satisfy them.
And in this way, I create a mental space inside which we can take care of one another instead of making the war.
If you're one of those people who go with everyone, who always have to say yes, one of those people I call, "I'll ask myself in the end," it's clear that you're not only losing time, but you also lose the sense of meaning of the things you do.
If you start to yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand which actions you put in the field to preserve them, then the game becomes something inside which you can become the pattern of the table.
It's starting to work on me, considering myself a cause of the things that didn't go as I wanted, instead of their simple effect that I also started to have to be a better person.
When I was writing to the university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology.
To understand them that with my matter there were practical tools, sometimes fast, to bring great value inside their lives.
But friends, I met with a couple of problems.
Stereotypes.
Prejudice.
The psychologist is the doctor of the mates, the psychologist is the doctor of the debts, but I had to talk to a friend, but I went to the park, but what should I do?
But would I have to lament myself?
Or could it not tell you how beautiful psychology would have had to try to change their priority?
I had to quit my dream.
But I had to learn to speak a language, which was the one that didn't happen, as the one next to the object.
I had to learn the dynamics of virtual fish.
I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way.
I had to learn to listen to their needs instead of my owning.
During a short time, following this direction, I got results for me unimaginable.
When I finished my primary school and his transfer, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I don't know what to do.
I thought, and until I decided, I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as he understood him.
I was transferred here.
I went home, I killed the computer, and I registered a video I carried on YouTube, in which I spoke about psychology.
Here, for the chronologist, I'll talk about how to take bridges, because maybe you think it's.
In a short time, my YouTube channel became a reference point in Italy for what psychologists look at.
Thanks to this thing, every day thousands of people get closer to psychology, discussing some of the stereotypes I mentioned before.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm in 79: I spread psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best schools, in Italy, leaves my review.
And what struck me more about everything was the recognition that the colleagues, at the beginning of a little strange, wanted to leave me.
Because, obviously, they saw that my attempt to innovate the profession, the way to communicate it, had something sense.
And Lombardia was read to the president's vice-president of the psychologist.
Dreams don't become reality because, fortunately, or because you've had that.
The theory that must have is the one that keeps moving forward, who doesn't know how it is built and needs to distrugle you.
Because the culprit should do it, it's also so much.
You must discuss your identity, your points of belonging to your certainties, your habits of always.
So, if there's something I learned from all this inner journey, it's that the most delicate transition, but also the most urgent one must come to our internal.
Scientists made you a question: if we had the chance to express a desire, one only to modify a aspect of your life that doesn't happen, we've talked about the work, the physical perspective, the short story.
Well, in fact, I'd like to leave you with a gift, how much less try it.
It's a small question that was personally very useful and based on the logic that, to get to produce big changes, we have to focus on many small actions.
What is the smallest and simplest thing that you could do until now, until you're, when you're home after this beautiful newspaper, and that will allow you to take the first step to put your life into the direction that you've explained?
You can think.
What is the smallest, the simplest thing you can do to put your life in the direction you live?
(Applause)
(Applause) (Music) I have all the keys of the burgon, right?
"What's your demand?"
Or do you do it by yourselves, right?
But where do you put the bags?
The mathematicians are the tests.
I've done the call roots, I'm sure it's time to change.
Have you done it when my mother comes?
Do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to talk for eight minutes, and I want this time to take it by myself, here.
I had a dream of creating a bunch of integration, of diversity and diversity.
The percussions are so fast, so immediate.
They take the distances and unite the battles.
We're partners, we're lost in seven.
Seven kids.
I see them, I see Laura, Paola, Daniele.
I saw them grow.
Our tests were the marketing, the day of the test, where this stadium was entered in the Music of Andreoli.
We took the first bidons, we were together, the first waves together.
We decided to become a good mark, from there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical brands and travels: the first businesses, the first brands in good pieces.
The first satisfaction, the first encounters, the first satisfaction for the kids, for us, for everything we were doing, but especially the first applause.
Unfortunately, a night of the 20th of 2012, the world was crossed, in the true sense of the word.
All the cases were completely unbearable or crossed.
A strong earthquake shaped our earths, and from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of the thousands.
For all the inequalities, we were called this.
As I said, the houses were no longer agible, very crossed.
Our proof room, our place where there were all the markets, was completely distrustful.
And the tools were inside.
What did we do?
I, the Sahara, Marco, Fede, Matteo, we all looked for them, in the Etendopoli and the Robots.
We were able, fortunately we found everything.
We've finished all of us inside a tender, in a tender, in the seventh of Middle Ages.
In that trend, there were magnificent things: we've come to fear, sounding stronger, because the cold flag sounds stronger than the earthquake.
We looked at ourselves in the eyes, with the Earth that was shaking, to look for a smile, a look.
It's the land shaking.
At the same time, we built the first tools: the monkeys that became constructed and suited with ping pong racks, the scars of scars became crowned houses.
We were constantly working, always, there was an amazing energy, even if we were at a terrible moment.
The inside was born in our first protocol, we decided to put it on a real sponsor.
However, the group's components were increasing, the friends spent the word by 20 that we were, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We are part of the construction of the first protocol: the white.
Why the white man?
Because there were smaller loops, bigger loops, and the white genius.
At that moment, we all moved together as a magnifying glass white.
And immediately after, we did the year later, we did the protocol, the swarm, we became all the Marines.
Because we really wanted to navigate and also move for a moment of our Earth, to breathe for a moment.
Then, last year, we made this marine monster.
After 50 years, this flying boat is to finish this year, the sea of the Moon.
The sea from the Moon, we wanted to close a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There were so many things inside this tenderness, and none of us would never have thought that a tender could change life, but we did it.
But I want to tell you one thing: 150 concerts around the History, and the minutes are finishing me, the stage of the first magician, the concert in the TV program at home, and the radio stage.
We made them really many, and also to me, being prevented.
Because this is precisely, and it's exactly the scenery of life, that of the factory, of the sweat, but also of freshness, that is so much possibility to the future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality?
Now I have to come back from the fruits.
They hope there's still so much to build.
Thank you all.
(Music) (Applause) One, two, three, three.
(Applause) One, two, three.
(Applause)
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Ferradini, and in fact I was born as a lawyer, until the moment I asked myself what happened in the last 250 years.
There are 250 very important years that have radically changed our history, and that we live today.
We talk about social innovation, and my question is: What is this social innovation?
And above all, our Italy, which is often so biased, is a ready country to incorporate these digital innovations.
It's ready to be tested at the same time of innovation.
This is the digital metaphor, we all take it to us, an object, I believe so everyone, that, in fact, incorporates an evolution that was extraordinary to its own attracted these 250 years.
It's the phone, the phone is a technological solution that belongs to the industrial revolution.
It's an evolutionary computer, and the computer belongs to the Internet revolution.
It's connected, and once again, this is an invention of the Internet revolution, of the Internet, of our history.
Nevertheless, these three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new time, that we have, in some way, strictly battled arbitrally in the 2000s, that we are living today.
Let's try to understand then what happened in these 250 years, that summarize the industrial revolution, the Internet revolution and the Internet soldiers.
The Industrial Revolution, when we look at it, we probably remember it as a Ferrovia, which is what we've studied at the school book.
Actually, it wasn't just a philosophy: we, at the industrial revolution, are enormously debated.
They are enormous debates, for example, because we need the vapor motorcycle.
And the vapor motorcycle isn't just a vapor motorcycle, but, for example, with a tool that has favored and has resulted much faster, the carbon station.
And the network is possible to a lowly inferior cost.
And then the vapor motorcycle has entered the corners, it has entered the founders, and it has started to change the modality, but it doesn't make sense.
We don't only need the driving force, we also need the scope motorcycle.
The scope motorcycle, because, on the other hand, it's an Italian invention.
In the motorcycle, we must, for example, the automobilistic industry.
In fact, before the Christmas industry, because the motorcycle was a motorcycle that couldn't go from iron.
When they were able to understand that it was a internal fuel motorcycle, when they couldn't understand how to get out of the bottle to realize it, and it became that scent that developed the automobilistic industry, everything that has happened to us.
But not only: in the industrial revolution, we are still in debates, for example, for the phone.
The phone is not only with the tool that allowed us to avoid continuing to see our letters and that has speeded the migration of these letters from one part to the other of the world, always more than we knew.
But it's also what has allowed us, and it has taught us to deposit the caves on the sea.
And yes, because then it was the phone, we couldn't try it in the sea, and then what did we do?
We interrupted everything.
No, we went forward, standing on the sea.
The first cavity, to give you a storal dimension, was taken from Italy between medicine and registered there.
Not just two populations agree, but the first cavity went there.
And we are around 1858.
There's the phone, we still live it today, we know what it is, we use it, it brings our voice.
In 187900 subscribed to Rome, it's only 1877.
Another invention and energy.
The first continental electric power in Europe was built in Viassandra de Gonda, where there is the Milan Rinascente.
Today, it's the scent: there, a time in 1873 is used the first electric center.
In that year, on December 30th, I was illuminated by scares.
A part of our history was born from there.
But let's move forward, let's try to take a little further.
We arrived in 1950, the Christmas is already getting to know a certain agency.
On the other hand, it was a century that is still in the course, but that has already lived important developments and also important emotions after cultural statistics.
But it begins to be born, to compose something that has never been in the first story.
They are the computer, they are calculations.
The colors that, at the beginning of the '50s, could be in a stadium like this, and they had functions of my broccoli.
They simply made the calculation faster.
But they went forward and evolving more significant, more structured, more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors.
They started to be the artificial intelligences we know.
But in these 50 years of the Internet revolution, something else happened.
There were research institutions, and above all, there were telescopes of all the defense keys that have led to develop subterraneous reactions, but not underground because they were not known.
At some point, we decided to open these laws.
And these challenges, called ARPA, ARPANET, became and started to be the World War that we know.
A diffused, or horizontal system, not hierarchical, extremely captured, capable of bringing information, of gathering information, of generating information.
To give you an idea, in 1981 there were only 300 the computer connected to the Internet.
In 1995, there were 25 million, not many.
Today, it's in the order of dozens of billion, because we're not only talking about computers we use, but of all these intelligent systems that connect to the network, to caricate data, to pick up data or to work data.
And when the mechanical strength, which was to communicate replaced and the Internet, we had the time that, if we started to live the time we've lived now, that we're living now.
The one that is called on the Internet.
And this, according to a phenomenon of creation and creative destruction, which is financially an industrial process that tells us that what is new progressively destroyed what is old because it needs space.
And we'll see better then how.
But this is the story of the great numbers, of the great inventions.
But there's a story that is a little more human, that belongs to us a little more, on which I try to make a reflection.
I try to accompany you.
It was 1863, when, little by little, the Italy hasn't done the Italian, the Minister Minister of the Minds established that the 27th of the Middle Ages is the payment and the public dependents, and from the end of the next months in which this happens.
At this moment, even if we don't realize it, we're introducing mini strangers, something extraordinary.
Before the richness of a family, more than a singer, was in his ability to produce good services that were necessary for its own support.
With the security of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky of the less risky stages of the development has started, in some way, from far away from the Earth, and above all, transformed the economic power of good and services in the production of one: the dwell.
But there's a second aspect, which is the fridge.
For us women, obviously, it was a revolution that has enough to read.
What, in fact, was the fridge, is that it's not only that object that liberates us from the emergency of going to spends every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to preserve, in a massive way, in a healthy way, in quantity of food.
So it gives us the possibility, once again, to focus on something that is not immediately the use of the daily life.
This is the man who begins to live to the end of 900, these are us.
At the time, as we said, I arrived at the computer and arrived at the Internet.
And then there's a figure that has characterized these years, that is an element that we can define as the qualifier of these years: speed.
We, 250, we weren't fast as we are today.
Today we do things very fast, we move fast and speed.
The speed of the challenges, the speed of the movements, the speed of our movement, and also the speed of our thinking that is not said the quality of thinking.
But we are very fast.
Even when something happened.
Typically, it's close when you look at the story, to understand the passengers of a century to the other, and sharing data that are not necessarily zero.
In 1900, 1900, 2000, when can we say that the 20th century ends?
I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two data that, significantly, follow the passage of a time from one another, 2001 and 2001.
2001 because, first of all, the American economy started to slow down, and on the other hand, there were Torri Gemelli, and so something in balance started to change.
These equilibrium that seemed solid, we realized that they were very fragile.
But we went forward until there was something that has slowed all the time: the biggest economic crisis that the Western world, the oriental world together, had never met.
There's not only America to have slowed, almost closed.
There was also the guide.
There were Europeans who were to fail.
The Greek was already the leaves of failure, they don't talk to us, but still there.
And it changed something.
But what did you change?
It's changed the economic paradigm.
We couldn't expect the biggest economic crisis that, in fact, was verified in 2008.
It was crazy not to think about it, but how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension?
When we can do everything, with many less people.
It was obvious that it would be dead: we were blind and we didn't know how to wait.
Look at these companies, these companies are stable multinationalities, in their majority, but above all, they are all companies that are Dante after 2011.
What did these companies do?
You're not innovating inventing something, you haven't innovated building something that wasn't there before.
But they started to do what we've always done, to buy, to travel, learn, in a different way, in a more efficient way.
And the Italy?
The adventure is often denied.
Let's look at the state of health and digital Italy, according to five factors.
Connectivity: we are ten percentual points under the media, but honestly we are almost close to a fast connection for 50%.
It's so much.
It's little.
Anyway, something.
Second, human skills, human resources.
The skills of curving it, of a different being between advanced and basic skills.
The competences based on what allow us to influence informatic systems, digital systems, those advances, those that allow us to develop.
A third fact that we have to look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it.
A third, a fourth element is the inclusion of the digital factor in productive processes.
So comets, or industrialization of products and services.
The fifth is the digitalization of the administration public.
Let's immediately use the field of some ambiguity, and we keep the first two that are important.
In other words, a good news for everyone: all the five elements are increased.
All of the five elements that are in a growth, in a growth speed at the end of two years ago.
So we are aligning European countries, and this doesn't work news.
As a matter of connectivity, we said it in ten points outside.
But, of course, it's enough to look at the newspapers, and you'll see that we're growing fast, there are new in exchange between new operators, new competitions.
It's building a very important and competitive tissue.
The use of the Internet, we are really opposite.
In fact, it was born a very profound change that is aligning us to the standards.
There are two factors that we have to look at with great attention that will be key for our country's future.
And they are the skills and the inclusion of the digital in the productive future.
In this way, we have to pay a lot of attention to the characteristics of our country.
We have two engines: the first driver is what made the Italy in the '50, there are the small companies.
According to being, the small business, something not useful, not effective, not paragonable to the big multinational companies, in fact, are probably the most effective tool to interceive the speed of change: they are agile, they are speeds, they are small.
They know how to do something extraordinary that the Made in Italy has an excellence in the production of service, in the production of products, which is quite unique in their gender, in all the voices.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, competences inside these realities.
It's an internal segment of the market in an extraordinary way, generating wealth for the whole tissue that I'm trying to you.
And this is the first assium we have, the first great motorcycle.
The second motorcycle that is in Italy, is its cultural artistic heritage.
A heritage that, for her existential nature, thanks to God, is an analog heritage that will get an analog heritage: we can't digitalize the crop.
But is it possible that tourists visit only three cities?
Venezuela, Rome, and then Rome.
But the wealth of these three cities don't make the wealth of our country.
And we're learning, maybe we've tried to start, but we're fast to recover, to include this heritage inside a knowledge system that allows us to carry it and enjoy it, and to make it not only to visit three centers, but to visit all our country.
I believe that this is the greatest urge we can do to our lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The topic I spoke about in a certain sense is the opposite act of the word that unites all this encounter.
It's the opposite of the word "share," because I'll talk not about sharing, but in a certain sense of the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'll talk about inequality, and I'd like to start with a question.
If someone asked you, let's say, in the 21st century, inequalities in the world, the inequalities between the citizens of the world are increased or are decreased.
I believe most of you will answer, "I'm increased."
After the newspapers, maybe you'll reach the precious goal, they've increased exponentially.
And if I asked you, "But is it in Italy?"
Perhaps the answer of many would also be.
I asked myself these questions in the last few years, and with the only 24th and the Foundation of video, I prepared when they were data, which is, financially, from 1960, with my colleagues, a report on inequalities, from the great majority of the countries in the world.
The result is what you see.
(Laughter) This is the curve of the inequality environment, directed to the citizens of the world.
As you can see, there was indeed an increase of inequalities, especially in the 80s, but from the end of the last century, at the end of the 90s, the compassionate inequality, now we are at the storal mining.
And in Italy?
In Italy, the neighbors of inequality are quite complicated.
Think that here we have an increase throughout the 80s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second public, we have a growing inequality trend.
How can we read these data?
A possible reading is to say, "We've traveled a collective bubble, because we continue to talk about years of argument of inequality, how much data doesn't support our feeling.
And there's really, surely, in this reading.
But we could also ask ourselves another question, and if the feeling of an increase of inequalities that many of us have the idea of inequality in which we think.
Maybe we have to reflect on the issue of inequality, on what we understand, for inequality.
Perhaps the concept of inequality requires some rethink.
We leave it temporary in suspicious this question and we move to Cambridge in 1928, a year before the great Church of the 29th.
Lickens, who was in Cambridge, pronounces a discourse in front of a famous audience, with the economic title for our grandchildren.
In that occasion, Keynes forms two professions.
The first says: between a century, the productivity of a work hour will be eight times the one of today, that is 1928.
And this profession, in fact, is made, because if you went to take the construction of the history of the economy, and also of ten, 12 times, in some case, 15 times.
So this profile is made.
And from this profile Keynes also found a consequence, an idea, which is that humanity, little by little, that is to say, will lose little to 100 years, to work less and he also said to work everyone.
And when he said less, he understood a lot less, he understood a week of 15 hours of work, or a three-hour work time a day.
And he saw a problem for this, because the question that was asked Keynes, but with all this free time, we would know how to use it well or not.
Well, apparently, this second to your officer hasn't made you realize.
Because we all see it, that we don't all work, and it doesn't seem exactly what we work three hours in the game.
But I make you notice that this profession is divided in two parts: we'll work a lot less, we'll work three hours a day, we're sure that we'll all work, it's certainly false, but the first part will work a lot.
Let's see what happened in Italy.
This dedication to work in the course of this trajectory represents the fraction of time that an Italian takes place in his life.
Your life, naturally, is potentially working, that is, for 15 years, then when we are able to compare a job.
If we look at this trajectory, Keynes's profession is actually made.
Because we were at the beginning of 900, almost 40% of our lives working.
And now we call it about 16%.
And the interesting thing is that this 16% makes two hours and a fourth a day.
For the barrier of the three hours, we've already screwed it.
Naturally, if this happened, there are also ears and banals.
For example, the old age is enormously aligned because we die very soon.
Life expectancy is the one who has succeeded in something like 27 years from the beginning of the last century, from 900.
There's another very positive reason, and other banks, if you want, our children often study, study long, our children even have.
So the youth is also aligned.
But there's a reason, perhaps more fundamental, for which our fourth of time dedicated to work is broken.
And it's the test of occupation, that is, the number of people who work.
This is the storal series of total occupation built for this occasion.
And this dramatic series, because it makes you see that at the beginning of the century, in all the monarchical era, before the Second World War, the occupation rate was often better than 70%.
Today we are very low, we are around 50 percent scarce.
Later, from 1968 and except one year, the occupation rate has always been inferior to 50%.
But a rate of inferior occupation to 50 percent, what does it mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, who don't work, right?
The pure consumers that don't perceive any network are more workers.
In front of this, it's enthusiastic and say, but this storal fact, we can also have a reaction and progress, beauty and modernity.
Things went like this because we can allow it.
But then we see if, in the country that the problem of modernity, that is, in the United States, things went the same way.
Because if this interpretation is fair, it should also be happened in the United States.
So we see the confrontation between Italy and the United States.
This is the historical series of time dedicated to work in life.
As you can see, in the United States, it only waves up to friends.
Then we establish, since there's a reading tendency to the increase while we crash.
But even more impressive, it's the storal series of the occupation rate, because here we see that even there's an increase, that small one you see below is the crisis of the 29th.
But after the 20th grade, we have a general tendency of the occupation rate in the United States at the increase.
However, in our case, we have a situation of reduction of the occupation rate.
But then, this is a pathology.
It's not normal that they are more people who consume without producing than the people who produce.
It's not normal that the majority of the population lives in a condition that I'll define: parassitary dependency.
"Dipendency," because I depend on the network of Twisia - this one can also be a family or the State - but it's parassitary because I consume or the available network without working.
I have a friend who does theater's act.
When I found these results, we were in the scene and I asked them, "But how did you represent this situation with an image?"
A situation of parasitary dependency, and he knows what answered to me.
With the hypothesis, it's that light that lives on the sphere of the hypothesis, but it's called buffag, some say bubbles.
Here it is.
If you want to have an idea of how it behaves, which is second, in which you can see the bubble that the bubble or the bubble on the prototype, or on the other big mammals, these birds also live on the bridges, on the bubbles, we have on the resources that are in the bubble.
If we're clear, if the bubble is happy or not, the eye that mistakes can mean that it's playing, it's that it's bothered by the light.
Anyway, this is what happens in nature.
But I'm not an ethologist.
And I do sociologist, so the question I asked myself as a sociologist is another.
How can we define a situation of this kind?
How do we define a society where there is a majority of pure consumers and minority of products?
We define a society where there is this kind of productive consumption.
The first one I said to myself, "But this is the ignorant society?"
Society, ladies and gentlemen, like the feudal society in which there's a ceiling that has put in the condition of living without working.
But naturally it's not enough: you have to add a qualification.
This is awesome, but our society is surely a condition that could be defined by ignorant society.
Why? Because we have
The consumers are more producers.
In society, it's simple, classic: we have the gentleman and the jungle serves that produce for him.
And here the report is clear: it's a relationship of commanding and subtomission.
In the ignorant society of Mars, things are a little more complicated: gentlemen have become many, and the relationship between the signs and the producers is much more complicated.
I believe that Dubezon, a great anthropologist, would have defined it a relationship of legacy owner, let's see why.
I'm a legacy because the bubble with the hypothesis is parassitism, and this is a advantage signed in green, but it's also dependence, because it depends on the food that is in the spices of the helicoport.
The red light indicates a disadvantage.
And also from the point of view of the producers, we have, again, a green fresh.
The hypothesis is autonomous, it doesn't need bubble, but it's somehow in an obligation report, as we are, in the colors we maintain, because we can't nourish the fish that live on their spices.
So the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of legacy.
But it's a situation that's not fine, it's a situation in which there's a new problem of inequality.
And now we arrived to the question I had asked about Keynes.
Today, maybe, the real inequality and the inequality of access to work.
The access to work is very similar to our social system, but if inequality and access to work we can use the tools of the analysis of inequality, that is to calculate a efficient concentration of genius, which is the tool with which we can measure inequality, we can apply it to the voice.
There are people who don't work, who have a means of work, who have two jobs.
And the position of the adventure, in this scale, of inequality, of access to work, is dramatic.
The position of the History is to be great in the graduation, together with Turkey, the country in which inequality reaches the maximum, but simply because there's the exclusion of women.
If we were a Islamic country, we would probably have the palm of this gradual.
The best situation is that of Norway, with the United States, messes in the middle.
They need us to become an Oxis country, normal, seven million jobs.
How did we get to this?
This is the story of inequality, of access to work in Italy, always measured with the Careficient of Gini.
You see, it's something clamorous, that inequality is the minimum during the monarchical age, especially under the faster, and it's massive in the public age, especially under the second public that we live in.
There are 7 million jobs positions.
If we had seven million jobs in more, our families would perceive 1,000 euro a month, in more, we would have 12,000 euros of round, in more, in the year, and our State would have 150 billion euros waiting.
As much as the health and the school have put together, more or less in Italy.
But here I conclude, there's a word.
We have the scholarship to write in the first article of the Constitution, the History is a democratic Republic based on work.
We are the only country that has this in the first title of Costitution, and we are the worst country together with the Turkey of the West.
So, or we change things, and we create the seven million jobs that eat, or maybe better to cancel the article one of the Constitution.
Because, being so, things sound like a bubble.
Thank you.
Thank you.
