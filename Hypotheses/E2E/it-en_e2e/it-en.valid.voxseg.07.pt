In 2016, I was given a prize.
From the National Forum Fortching Learning, supported by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, from the name a little particular, they are born in Church.
The motivation of this award was my availability in the confrontation of the students and my ability to create data environments.
Even less formal, more relaxing, let's imagine that this is a big university class.
The usually entered class.
The first ten minutes, when the students enter and get there.
I put my computer to explain and put a classic music, I think this is the first step to create less forming data environments and try to maintain the attention of the students.
Unfortunately, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a method used until the old age.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, the storytelling is a method based on the use of narratives.
To transmit knowledge to students.
And just with this moment I'd like to start my lesson, explaining to you, describing you a topic about the mouth of everyone, normal.
But artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that children tell, I'd like to start my story.
Well, there was once.
Second World War.
In 1942.
The UK region.
Blece and Park.
One.
A huge president of London.
And there was a young and 30 years old.
Alan Turing.
Let's move forward the team College of Cambridge.
And they get a research doctor in logic, at the Prince University, in America.
At that time, the Tedes used a machine.
Special: Enigma.
It was like a writing machine.
The operator digitalized details, but since stuck on a paper those letters, I stuck other letters, according to a code imposed mechanically under the sea.
The texts used this mechanism to communicate among them.
Anyone would interceive this paper in front of you without any sense.
It was shouting.
Alan Turing was one of the main figures in Blece Park.
Keep in and build them a machine.
It's the one you can see, behind, able to decipher these tests written by the roofs.
For this invention, we think that war is finished with two years of anticipation, saving many human quickly.
In the adventure, continuously, after the war, to do its logical research.
And it's considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
So, with your Turing machine, he formalizes the computer thing, even before the computer was created in practice.
In 1950.
It's an article about the "Mind magazine."
"Computing Machines and Intelligence."
But where does the test propose?
The question behind the testing is a very precise one.
They can think machines.
From here, artificial intelligence began.
Probably many of you have seen the movie of Emitation Game, the game of limitation, I want to explain to you.
Can we ask ourselves if there's a person here?
The request is to be the computer.
That asks questions and on the other hand, a machine M is an operator.
In an alternative way, the machine M and the speaker or form the answers to the person standing.
It's said that the machine takes over that Test-Touring if the person is not able to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the operator: this is the limit.
But the machine must have special characteristics to overcome the attitude.
But it must interpret natural language.
The question that comes from the person must represent knowledge to form the answers.
In other words, we must think in an automatic way to form these answers.
And it must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence: one of these is cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this process, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to capture thinking in the moment they are in, or we try to modify thinking at a psychological level.
That's why we say that artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive neural science and psychology, according to this approach, the assunction that if we can really have a representation of human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of the laws of rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man?
All the men are mortal.
Socrates are dead.
This is a deductive argument.
It's trying to build educational arguments and make them a true conclusion: from here the logic is born, according to the approach of the laws of the thought, from here it's born in a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational agents.
A rational agent, an entity.
(Laughter) It must act.
It must be adapted to the context.
And it must be carried out objectives, and know how to bring them to end.
And it must act in a rational way.
So the Turing test is linked to intelligent people, reformulating the Turing phrase, a machine to think, we can say, "Can we create a machine?"
An artificial agent.
I'm able to think, exhibit intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence, so it's the purpose of creating artificial entities, intelligent, your phone is an entity.
Among the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence as psychological construct.
Once we have more knowledge.
On this thing?
It's close to build artificial, intelligent identity and support of humans, it's a cycle.
But let's see today.
If machines can think.
And I'd like to explain to you to describe the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I'd like to use five classes.
To classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We have subtle agents.
For humans, about human beings.
We have the optimal agents, I want to explain to you with some examples: optimal agents are those who manage better than all humans, and we can't do better, for example, agents that solve the cube of Rubik, which has created a four in the best way, which is capable of developing in zero, 73 seconds.
Do we have the sovereign agents?
Why do they act better than all people?
For example, in the game of the rocks.
In the game of the scary.
A few years ago, the Russian Scakis camp was killed by an artificial agent.
We have people who suffer humans, those who manage almost like all people, for example in the game of Poker Texano.
To answer the question of the kiss.
We have human people.
What do they act?
Almost like all people, for example, in cognitive activities like the crowned words, or the classification of image.
And finally, we have subtle people who manage the worst of all people.
Exemples are the case of objects.
The recognition of caligraphy, the vocal recognition, the translation of a language to the other.
But if there's something that artificial agents, today, are not able to do, for example, is a disambiguation: we're talking about the fruit like this.
The mum.
Or are we talking about the Mark of the body Apple?
And one thing that agents are not able to do is the reasoning in the ideal world in uncertainty situations.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence, for which we think we are far from overcoming the test.
Let's see now in the future.
They will be able to think.
A few years ago.
In America, a thing was introduced by the name of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest experts in artificial intelligence in the world.
Imagine the time line.
Imagine a line that indicates human intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a red line that indicates the machine intelligence with an exponential ambition: this blind moment.
What is the challenge?
I've predicted in the Moore's laws, for which computational compassion, for example, measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, radiated for two years and in four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to make this computer complexity to reveal the human brain.
I don't see anything.
Well, in 2020, we would have access to 1,000 dolls to this computer capacity.
In 2025, secondary and crossed, I'll never be able to get rid of our brain in a precise way.
And finally, in 2029.
And the machines will spend the test, they will overcome the test.
And then, in 2045, and the indication of the moment it will have the technological singularity.
In which machines will follow the intelligence of the cars and will follow an exponential environment that will radically change human intelligence.
In his article.
It's published on the mind, Turing didn't only proposed its test, but it also proposes new objections against its same test.
These objections are us, butions against artificial intelligence.
Any year ago?
I was a student at the University of Varese.
I followed a path of episode, of ethics and ethics of computer science, I got from the Gaithan professor to Aur√©lio Lanzerone, unfortunately, a few years ago, one of the compounds we had to move was to propose a decade.
I was the only one that proposed a decision formulated with mathematical communication.
What about human stupidity?
Then I want to describe it in simple terminals: let's suppose to take the intelligence of all people, to put the seed, the symbol of submission to the minister side of the equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine, so we get an intelligence equality, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were us?
But to transfer our intelligence inside a hand.
And this becomes more intelligent than us, it's also true that we've left the machine to become more intelligent than us.
So to conclude my story.
And by getting rid of the initial question, the machines can think.
I'd like to leave you with a open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
How many of you today have taken pictures?
Thank you.
OK, well, this gives me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in the bathroom, and it serves everyone, I'm the creative director of a study that takes care of photography, and I've spent many photos with their phone, which doesn't make me a photographer, I've spent the last three years.
This is me, immersed among my meters, but there are many other things that there is in the production of such a contemporary scenario that changes while we're here to discuss: this is only one of the questions I've asked myself in these three years and that interests me to share their impact on the market, its product and professional photography.
To find answers to these questions, I tried to open a confrontation.
With photographers, careers, criticisms, theories that have embraced the challenge of this new means, I asked them to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the successes, of their shared and images through the cell phone.
To find answers, I looked around and arrived in New York, at the DSC of the Fotore of the New York Times Megers in Cathy Ryan, in Berlino.
So, in the IM sede, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock, in Parigi, in the rooms of Parifot, one of the most prestigious fears in the world, to enter those places in which photography is distributed and it changes these ingratulations.
To find answers, I tried to look beyond the surface of the great common places of the contemporary.
For example, the selfie, for example, to get involved, simply, to a delirium narcissistic as some psychologists have sustained with the body dismorphism, and to get involved in their own image, as a health of the generation of the millennials, or not to be seen as "Keyard Ben".
Look at the slower.
The phyto-binding aesthetics that has signed and still marks our mobile vision: this is my cane, Zazi, designed by my photographic experiments, is simply the result of a world's world's worldwide, or, instead, as it has sustained the social and historical vision, even economical.
But photography, I believe, isn't the territory of answers, it's the territory of interpretations, and of this phenomenon I've tried to give an interpretation in a book called "I Revolution" to a story of photography, because in front of the flower of images we've always tried to draw a map.
So, if not to find the route, at least to understand what we are.
And at what point we are, the story of the photographer is short, but in a few years, or in a lot of millions and millions of people, a new code that exceeds every linguistic barrier, used daily to communicate, to manifest themselves, to feed a constant flow of images that involves an angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collective world, if you want, that has impressive numbers: every two minutes, today, we take more images of how many humanicans have been taken in the interaction of the year century.
In addition to 350 million of these images are carried every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram: the production, the diffusion of images, of activities that, until a few years ago, looked at a direct amount of professionals, in which we define ourselves through the images we produce.
And if the mobile photographer is a new language, then it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that is still strongly signed by that process of liquidity, so brilliantly individualized by the Fozigmunt Bauman philosopher, as a typical of a modernity, the coppy, I'm always more fascinating, and here actors are unstable points in a universe in a movement, which is composed of compounds.
It's constantly based on the instant gratification of our need of sharing.
But in a world where each one, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone, which remains the professional photographer, and that differentiates passing by accidental and conscious photographs.
On the one hand, the facility of using the cell phone camera transformed the photography of mixing professionals, the universal language, taking action to the process of democratization of photography.
I started with Lera Kodak and arrived until the iPhone.
On the other hand, the use of the cell phone as a reward tool offered to professional photographers.
The new possibilities in approach to history, the contents, the subjects, even from one part, the opening to everyone, to all of us, of a dialogue channel, with an exclusive audience, as a producer of images.
He put me in crisis the social function, the economic position, based on thinking of the rule that had the photographer and social network, in the first Arabic, showing that it's a powerful tool to orient public opinion and a machine that is hardly controlled by the Greeks, this is an image that has dedicated to the rule of the photographer in the first Arabic, on the other hand.
You've tried to think that the possibility of internal interaction, through the Italian photographer, Giulio Napolitana and George Photography, for example, a new model of New Smaking, and I've seen the newspapers, which, for example, has been created by a photographer from the National Photography of the Real Photography of the Station of the Fotography of the Fotography of the Fotography of the Real Menomenon, which has always been created in the United States and its Real Menomenon.
Benjamin Loui.
Oronna VIP, who has used and use the smartphones in conflict territory, showing how the agility and the description of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of deepness, photography as a cup that belongs to a simple smartphone, has explored new paths for the first hand.
Bread Mengin, who used it for sport photography, exclusive territory of photographers with hyper-performant appearances, and made a vehicle of intimate narration in the middle of the basketball.
That's it.
Research Cirnandt, who enjoyed discretion and manner for photography street, creating a very personalistic aesthetics.
(Laughter) I'll tell you that it made me a little bit of denouncement, going back to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, and creating a community that attacks the parts around its work.
MTIX that uses it daily to build its family album, inerting a reflection on how Instagram changes the facts of our privacy, and the way we build and preserve our visual memory.
Peter of Campo, who, through the African Council, has shown how the photographer's mobile phone, far from limiting simply to generate waste and visits, can also be used to discuss the Western stereotypes.
Like Stephan of Luigi who interpreted the Omer's history with the cell phone, telling in the series AIV, one of the oldest heritage of the Western history, with the most new vision tool, or how did they do these photographs, which we don't know how to do?
That's it.
Trying to go to the outskirts of action, or looking for personalized tags on the event, to avoid more than registering.
Creating images that are never straightened to reality, but that are born from a different way of thinking and performing their contents to be diffused on profound platforms between photographer and content, because anyway is the tool that is reflected.
Only if the photographic projectuality and smiled by a solid writing, articulated in a powerful way, could distinguish themselves from the visible rumor of the bottom that offers us the eyes.
All of this, I believe.
It's still the difference between a photograph that was the real resource.
Her bullying, reproduction, her self-reference and sharing, and a photograph that can still be a cultural metaphor, thank you.
And do you feel it?
I felt it like that.
What we believe is silence.
And actually?
It's 50 ERC of electric currents.
Fifty-thirds that are immediately entered in our lives.
And we wake up from the illusion that silence exists.
(Audience) Yes, but...
Yes, that's not it.
So also in this room, those proofs, these seeds, and put a 50-year-old frequency.
So, do you imagine, right?
I went home after a job day, really stressful.
Mangicle, your partner, with your partner, except you're going to read in the bubble of your bed camera and think you're alone.
But no.
There's always her.
But this frequency of 50R.
Because I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible, in our cases, in our lives, but it's more or less this sound.
A positive one.
Or better, first of the negative aspect.
The silence doesn't exist.
But we have a positive aspect.
But we are never alone.
There's always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Very good.
Paranoid.
And if we look at it, as a drawing.
This frequency of 50 times is nothing more than a sound wave: a wave is now with a beautiful rich spectrum.
With which you can do music, and then I asked myself.
But why?
Why not make us music?
That's it.
I'm a composer of sound colonies, an artist, I'm now a little special, why?
I was complicated life deciding to make music alone and exclusively through rumor.
My parents?
So they divorced when I was little.
(Audience) Yes!
I know, you think this is the classic story in Strappa Lacre, but it was the revelation of my life.
In the loneliness of those days, in the weight of the void of that house, I started to make music with all the rocks around us.
So ...
Each income complement was no longer.
A classic fulfillment of network, closed, immobile, before voice.
But it becomes my musical tool.
With a joy between the other of my mom.
Because every roof wasn't looking at the bikes, on the other hand, "Mom, are you looking at me from the stream?"
I say, at some point.
I tried to become...
I was a normal person, trying to say, "Dad, why did I start studying?
Chut it, piano.
Then I liked Woody Allen, so I started to create the grandson, the problem I really liked Arenzo Arvor, who wrote a beautiful song in Bigoa, was coming like the first years of study in Genova.
I also quit Clarinetto.
That's how, to not go...
I make the illusions of my classmates.
But why did I abandon all this, why did I study and escape from that notation so rigid?
Because there's more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more sponsors in a rumor.
And I like to paragonate it to the problems of life.
All of us have attacked a rumor, a failure, something that made us think, but I'm sure that that this rumor made us grow much more.
From a smile.
So, what is my mission?
So when I'm a child, it's to transform a failure, a rumor in music, and to harmonize everything around me.
Let's go.
But I'll have everything, I say.
To make me a beautiful turning point, Gino Paoli, and everything would be concluded, but no, I'm complicated in this way life.
What is sound?
But above all!
What is the study, and with the saying, is one of the most difficult senses to understand, but also the most immediate, the most powerful.
To transmit an emotion: our inner eye, the protein of the oceans, our team, reaches the maximum functionality around the fifth week of gesture.
I say this week of gesture, this means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to listen even before seeing, and this is not a case.
Because the fact must be ready to what the hospital in life, once born, must be ready to the Nora texture, it shouldn't be afraid.
It must be ready, so not in case, if the mother, during pregnancy, listened to British bank, didn't have to stupid if the child once was born.
Yes, it will be listening, for example, Sex Pistols.
So, future, moms, I prepare you, and it's a richness that I personally pay attention to the musical choice: wait for the trap, more than another, OK?
What is it?
But sound.
"Yes."
And the sound is that one.
It's all that we're surrounded, and sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what, in our lives, is completely abstract.
But you don't see, you don't touch, but the colony is time for every day, the rhythm in our partner, the mother who screams us, because the mother screams us, still.
All of this is the sound colony of our days.
That's it!
Of course, the visual is much easier, I know it.
The visual is when we enter the system's hair, we say.
It's smaller than how I imagined them.
There's more small than what, there's more small than the man of Milan.
The smaller than San Pietro.
When you're younger, maybe?
This thing, as when a person sees me in video, or on stage, and then I tell you about people, tells me, "I imagined higher, of course, because it would be really impossible."
So ...
Going from this budget, the visual.
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, did I say it?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's imagine our lives, I'd like to genuine your ability to observe, so we're in vacation.
We're in the sea, not in case, and we started.
I'm a soccer blog, I'm a kilometer, a kilometer, a kilometer isn't - I'm not a prosecutive, then it's 360 - and I've arrived at the time of Cena - there's a doll - no, not eating the doll - because I have to take a lot of photos - well, I have a lot of photos, well, I have a blog of food, I don't know.
It's crazy.
(Audience) Yes!
But nobody eats the doll.
We photograph it.
We look at it, we do so many videos, but we never stop listening.
We never stop listening, but not even a person we know.
And I teach you a trick: when do you connect with someone?
The best moment to know the person is to stay in silence, that silence that, among the other, doesn't exist: go for two.
Listen, close and listen.
Like in this moment.
So, today I'd like to take you with me, I'd like to bring you with me.
I went around the world, I ended up evolving it.
Your perception of listening.
And I'd like to start by telling you...
The dream of my life, the dream of my life that was born from the listening of myself, for the first time, the listening of myself, was the 2013, I wanted to run away from the adventure, a series of failures, problems as another, but I started looking for a very far place from the History.
So, I decided to choose a city on the front.
And there was the Atlantis, yes, it's true.
There was still a lot, there was one of the largest cities, culturally, artistic, and really far from me: Shanghai, I decided...
I participated in a competition, I came to an artistic residence and started the most beautiful years of my life, for a simple fact that, for the first time, I was listening to myself: I didn't have money, I had so much fear.
I had an idea, but I was the only one to believe us, and it was the one that would have listened to the sounds of the whole world, of all the cities of the world, creating for each sound, a sound colony of every city, calling this project "Sound of Offsity."
And the whole part, really, from the sound of the cities, the cities are a great musical tool to wake up this musical tool, you can enter the last of the cities.
And I'd like to take you to this moment to Shanghai, where for 48 hours, I'm not registered, the sounds of the city.
And I created a sound colony, so at this moment.
I want to sound: Shangah.
The enemy!
Let's go!
It's in Ivo Mato.
(Video) (English) Hi, I'm a bit scared.
In my heart.
(Audience) Yes!
[A.DE.]
(English) Very good.
(Livox voice) (English) I accepted to stand up.
(Music) (English) I'm tired of the air.
(Video) (English) I'm tired of my life.
(Music) Thank you very much.
Okay?
You're still focused on the visual.
And this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, let's say it's...
You've all stuck to the visual.
Now, there's a city that's sure, you've photographed in every way, and you're wondering more than once, but that smoke that comes to the tombs that are made, but the bridge of Brooklyn can sound.
Yes, the bridge of Brookly is an exceptional that is located, completely online.
And do you want to join?
That's it.
Or the Counter, who is really touched on the side, is something very important to say.
Beautiful, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because on the other side of the world.
It's not magical because it's on the other hand, it's magical because under our eyes, every day.
And maybe many of you know a pair of places.
In this picture?
The sound rule is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, going around a city, losing yourself in the same city, well, I knew Genova.
I knew Genova because there were many times, I had evolvedly captured many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that between my favorite cities, now, scaven the applause.
I started to record the first sounds.
And the first sounds were given to these children, in this tube.
But from Ferro, an old man, they gave me this audio camp.
And I'll make you feel, before the Greek camp, and then, that's worked.
Let's go to the span of...
Come on.
And I like a bit - I've always done it - that I'm not normal, I've never been - I've attacked this beautiful, and it has restricted me a very low frequency that has become a synthesis.
MM: Of course, Genova is "Morzans."
(Laughter) It wasn't a battle, this is a serious thing.
To give the world.
And the writing, which you see constantly in the beach of Ferrari, is not just a writer, for me it's a great musical tool, helped me to support the beat of this column sound, and it's more or less like that.
The last sound, after I really want to sound like Genova, is the one of all the boats of the port.
That we are used to watch on top, but the sound of a tragedy that gave me a particular frequency that became melody, and when I created this microphone, I immersed it for 48 hours inside the Genova's portion, it's transformed into what the voice of the colony is gold.
It's true.
Hello, now.
I wanted to make you feel a genius, but I came to this point.
No, no.
Here's Genova as a sound.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
This is the sound of our passions, in my and your own.
And for how many people will tell you that I'm rumorous, stuck, out of time, I really want to listen to them, and I'll always bring you to school.
As it's said Guybek in Italian, the word generally used is restitution, it's not perfect, but the idea of the idea, in generating the idea of restitution linked to monetary restitution to beneficence.
A lot of times, instead, the restitution is linked to reproduce what you did, what you learned.
And going from the part of those who say, "It doesn't work anything," then in Italy it doesn't work anything in this country, we try it, so the next 18 minutes will share some point of this story.
Going from the end of the '90s, precisely, this is my son's army.
At the same time, my monkey organized the funds to pay the asylum material: it was an activity.
Very heavy, made with many parents, some of them said, "No, why should we help, we must think about the common state, but most of them make these extraordinary efforts?"
To help the asylum to help the community.
It's collected a million 200,000 allies, because I don't remember, I'm 600 euros away.
And it was one of the individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later, we transferred the United States, this is similar, the same similar school for a close school, this is the biggest child.
And there's a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we realize that it's a totally extraordinary reality.
In other words, the thing of the game Beck of the restitution is very normal.
So the extraordinary effort of an Italian genital, is ordinary for all that society, not that the American society is perfect, all the time.
I said this, the concept of restitution: I had fortune, I reproduce, I helped the school, I helped the university.
It helped the museum, the the the theater, there are all the communities, financially, of volunteer restitution, not that where there is no volunteer, but there is a phenomenon and a positive circle, and then there are also the mechanisms, there are the processes.
But it works, it's based on this.
I'm ten years old, some of you may have known it, this is the sidth launch of the famous Obama Cher.
It's a title that says: "Desistemy is from now on."
Trump is trying us very actively to ask ourselves if the system is given at the moment.
Obama Lancer famoso bank, and there was an incredible technological debate.
Technological advance has been 600 million dollar, so not worried about these things that didn't happen only in Italy.
They build a site that doesn't work, many million contacts, and this is the standard answer they receive, in short, believes that it doesn't end for a few days, but then someone stopped criticizing, and it's enough to do, to criticize, to help, which is difficult, extraordinary, for us, it's not a common thing.
This is Time Magazine's coverage, which refers to the experts of technologies sent by Google and other companies, has been offered, and I agree with the Bianca House, they have no clues, they've been in a few weeks, at a decim of the costs.
I would probably have criticized, "But Google, surely, your interests are this."
And the extraordinary effort, and not the ordinary, I've seen that I've finished at the Time Magers' discovery, it's very interesting.
I want to explain what was spinning, I'm spinning from people, more still.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this suit, this bag, and they decided to reproduce the experiences that had filled their lives, experiences.
In this case?
But they look at the ability to manage big technological systems, complex, unbearable, repeatable processes.
And make them, sometimes, unbearable and unbearable.
It's to create a replicable system that is the USA, this effort was born.
A system replicates what we hope to do with us.
I want to talk about the word model, because one also implies the models, the ones who have taught us perseverance, the desire to never move, to continue to insist, the energy, the empathy, so these models that are part of this bag, that we need to use, we want to reproduce.
For me, obviously, it has played not only what we said until now, but also the Italy factor, almost 20 years ago, the idea of helping there was also because I'm Italian.
And I wanted to do it exactly: Do you know what Ray is?
To do or not do, there's no attempt, maybe the Italian river is to do or not do it, there's only to criticize.
A few years later, we're five to meet Mateorence without Francesco, and the Visicom Valli came to the sensibility of the general transformation, something that has discarded us a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of processes, for the digital transformation of the public administration.
It requires me, because it doesn't come to help us in Italy for a couple of years, I think it's reflected in the packaging of my wife, Monica, and I talk to my genius, to have the brief, I decided to apply a methodology of choice, and I didn't get it, or I don't even think of new approaches.
The choice was made, and so it goes to the Rome for two years.
A topic of...
B.G: Ah, Amazon.
But those who have to do it, Molina Amazon, Probono, Maiday, something will give you underwater, these are only many phrases, I have to say that we've also received so much support, so at this moment we're focusing on this part, but in a positive part there was.
But I was mentally preparing for skepticism and bureaucracy, people ask me, "But do you expect these little bubbles, and yes, I didn't expect it, of course?"
But scientificism doesn't often have cinism that characterizes you a certain mentality.
But I will never do it, of course, because you have the rights, I've heard a lot of this kind.
And our country, in fact, lacks a lot the sense of common good.
And to do things because you think of helping, to improve a situation not only because it's not interested.
And here's it: for the days of you, this is a commission, for the most elderly you recognize it, like me, the Migrea comistry.
I say this because the beautiful title, my movies, after the beginning of extraordinary commissioners, is simply because it's the rule that allowed me to be able to take people out of the public administration.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is.
As the systems from inside don't become, we want to try to transform them with people who come from outside, where the fact that they don't know the administration public is a asset, and not a variability, it's a advantage and not a disadvantage.
So, financially, we created a small team: I want it to be a small team, I've read 25 people, a large world, but it's also too small, of technological experts around 80%, the 20% inspired by making legal, legal, governative, communication.
Here you can see the post I had done when, by myself, I started this adventure, I said, because we don't write what I think will happen, in this way we want to attract talents, the talents you live in Italy, or that you want to come back.
It's also temporary, it has a very well-being compensation of what you see, as I'm convinced, so I've put myself in the idea, but how do I convince someone to do the same thing I'm doing here, in the '47s, all the United States, the United States, in this massive sport, the investment of infrastructure?
We created the vision.
That the operative system of the country is a series of fundamental components that can build simpler services for citizens, the public administration and companies, through very beautiful products of implementation, is "lacrime and blood."
I've continued, in my place, the soccer field in Salita, since the American soccer, I'm wrong.
And I continued, we'll also find many rules, complicated, sometimes incomprehensible, it's a easy prediction: we must learn to manage with intelligence and bureaucracy, many of them will not understand how public administration works, they've already tried us in many, they've failed in Italy, it doesn't work like that.
And I continue?
We'll get many criticisms: some comments will be useful, others will be precise and prejudices, the criticisms of the first type riding of people who want to really offer their contribution and have found them a lot.
The second type of color they want to defend the state of the school is that they always see the bubble in the middle of the void.
Or that, simplerly, the power is drawn, and this is our problem.
To teach things that don't work.
Remember this image: the first, men and women on the cover of Time Magazin.
That's it here, so, despite I tried to scorage the most possible people among the blocks, I received about three,000 questions, that at least a hundred decently qualified, we've used digital tours for the Colloqu, an app called Jazz, we have it in Beth in the government's website, and it's a technological test.
And the team has reached the Church mass of Cherpa, so there are seven people in the genius, now we are a little more entertainment, and it has immediately started to operate, what do we do?
In fact, we take care of Draulica.
These are the tubes of the administration public, some of them to do a lot about connecting, because the big problem is that the systems, the applications, anything that should be interconnected, and asylum, don't connect.
And I'm not only talking about machine-machine, I'm also talking about people who don't want to explore their own data, their own software, their own applications.
So it's introduced to the concept, to explain it, and in years to implement it, to connectivity, to interruptability.
It's sponsoring the code of public administration.
The scores show us the software, of course, and make so much activity of management, so so much hydraulic activity.
We can't also be pictures.
To make the services of the beach, in time, you have to make them better, to make them easier, to make them easier.
Well, all these things are done in parallel, but without the tubes you can't do the chest.
After a few months, in the midst of 2017 we wrote the piano "Trienna," the Administration publication, we did it together with the agile of other people who helped us, what is it particularly about the trendal transformation for the public transformation in my internship?
In other words, there's something that exists.
Two are written in a clear, technological way, but also in the process.
For the first time, it was assessed and sponsorized by the government, Palo Gentiloni has affected the decrease of the presence of the minister, the digital staff is a priority of the government, the triennal piano.
It requires a team game to simplify public administration, the city of the citizen, particularity of the piano.
Well, one day to the year, because the planes can't be static, especially in technology.
And the administrations are appreciated.
But what is this, this is the only way to do the pieces in Italy, in the public administration?
It's regulating the technical rules and you read exactly three pages of view and connections to other norms in other rules, in other things: so the trendal plan is put on Githab, the technology, the public administrators, the software, then we can't fly these things, but we can do it.
And to improve it.
Instead of dedicating this moment, particularly, and this is always a part of the piano to the digital platforms: digital payments, one, electronic positions, electronic letter, which is a habitant platform, digital identity.
And the greatest project that we've followed is called national and President's population.
Let's put this, technologically, all the data of you, citizens, that at this moment are at 8,000 different sides, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, in the only database, synchronous.
In other words, where data is talked about them, especially the synchronized ones, and they talk to the rest of apps of the administration, when I'm transferred to a common to the other, I have to say all those things I've already had to know.
Well, we're solving a technological solution, then we'll do so much about the process.
Two weeks ago, we made a series Akaton.
where 800 software educators have worked on that brilliant application, they were used in 96 interventions, Bagfixing, so they brought problems of software, a improvement of documentary, and even new projects.
It was made in 25 Italian cities.
Well, I also know that it's not Italian, but there are many Italians who are helping us from the technological point of view, out of the History.
All of this reflects - we're talking about sustainability and scalability in the sight of beauty for sponsors of Italy, like T, where they're exposed, all the documentary, in all the codes, but they're always more, apps.
In the Italian publication, now there will be a fifth of what would be left, maybe even less.
The future is today, we dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that normally don't limit themselves to do hydraulic, I also enter the boat.
But it's true that the paintings are completed, sorry, I insist, this could be, for example, one of those things that would add to high-pitched version to the digital citizenship, to the electronic identity, to Nepher, and already functional.
And all of this, the goal is to make it easier, to familyize the interaction between citizens and the public administration.
With a simple interface, we're dreaming a little, because of work we'll really do so much, but it's different from this vision.
A few weeks ago, the storm.
But at the age of 150, they wrote an uncertainty, the world that expects us, I asked many people to talk about what they think can happen, I was asked to talk about the simplification of the lives of all the days of the citizens, I took the opportunity to write an article that I want to mention to you.
Some fish.
It's a desire or dream, maybe we do it, we want a country where politicians who try to understand the digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rule and not the exception.
A country where they read recognize and promote the right to innovate, to embrace it.
A country with technological skills that are also inside the State and public companies, a country where there are more public and private companies guided by 30 years than for 70 years.
Imagine, in the end, a country where working for public administration is a north, where better brains make money to work in public research centers, which are green and precisely the centers of excellence and innovation.
What brings development to the country?
That's why it's a dream.
And that the components to do all this, digital, technological processes, are really many and maybe too many.
But if it's not a dream about which points are difficult, they can do things.
First to conclude.
This is my mom who belonged to the people who told me, "Who did you do it?"
And here it's due to some parts in this theater, among the other.
But at this point, it's more calm, and I couldn't explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the digital Tinder, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
And if you want information about us?
That's our site and our social media.
Did you know the possibility to make a wish?
One only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't go as you want.
So, what would change?
And what would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your genius, your employees?
You're afraid, you're looking at you, it's for that, because here behind you know there's.
So raise your hand those who would change something in your own body, maybe lose some kilo, or maybe win them in muscles.
AC: Ah, well, here there's a little more, there's more freedom.
Let's raise your hand those who would change the same, the better they understand.
Of this, I was sure I would have traveled everything.
Or maybe you're the ones who would change their part.
Audience: Yes.
(Laughter) The more times, during my life, I asked myself this question: Let's understand if I won't change the part, and the answer was worth it because I would have a more united family, but my parents didn't separate.
In the media, I would have wanted to be better, for the pleasure of the kids.
In Liceo, I wanted to feel the most complicated teachers, they seemed to me all the hostiles, and I was reflected in music, here the great void to make in the living room.
I went to the university, I wanted to work, but I found myself with the difficulty of access to the work market, so all the first part of my life I had to fight and fight to try to understand how to change the things that didn't go well from what others thought about me to the great economical hands, from interpersonal relationships.
It has my characteristics, acquired from birth.
And when did they become a psychologist?
Instead, I looked at my research to other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
These strategies, if they used in a small dose, could also take some benefits, but if, as most cases happen, were the only three maps to play in front of a crisis, not only they didn't solve anything good, but they ended up maintaining their problem.
The strategy, today, more diffused, is it?
(Laughter)
And we lament it a little bit of everything.
There's crisis, there's no work that's traffic, that's cold, that I'd have done in a different way, we'll miss it because there's no justice, we know many people who fall in the bottle of the window, and this paralyzes you, typnotizes and wake up to the spot.
I remember a girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything else than to get rid of when she started to talk to her, then from the girl with whom she had translated her.
So the fact that I didn't have work, the last work of the government that hadn't helped it, felt of a value, capacity, and now that the mind had completely colonized all its daily life.
But lamenting for all of us is a bit the great attempt, because with a small effort you can get a great result.
To review the rule of the victim, that was listened, comfortable, helped.
But beat well.
You can lament yourself at night or day, alone or with friends.
Do you have a voice or your mind?
You can lament yourself of something already happened, or something that maybe a tomorrow could happen, you can lament yourself in tattoo, or as much more often happens, you could lament yourself in reason.
Because we all have many reasons to be able to lament.
But the truth is that for how much you will make you difficultly remember something around you.
It will change, elderly, you won't do anything else than giving more attention to what you say.
If the strategy that privileges, when things don't go as you'd like, is to slow down, presume that someone is at the study of a B piano to save the legs in Bocahall.
Another very objective strategy, when things are stretched, is to impose our need.
(Laughter) At the base of this mentality, there's a growing cultural factor, based on which we learned that if something doesn't work well, it's enough to change it, we can manipulate our pleasure, what surrounds us.
Don't you like the shadow?
But from the aesthetic circle.
You feel a little further, but why never be in the suffering, take two pillars and resolve it?
Your red wife, divorce.
At fresh, we all agree how many risks to the palm.
And your child doesn't listen to you, read it.
It's too big to not breathe it, send it from the psychologist, we're here for this, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice is for this profession, to make the world around you get involved in perfection with your demands.
(Laughter) The context inside which this energy strategy, in a very important way, are the relationships of bodies.
I remember one, a copy, during the collapse of which I didn't do anything else than listening to what, according to one, the other would have to change to solve the resources of their future.
Hey.
Well, of course you're to agree, but not even to prepare yourself in Chinese, which is also a classicone, and she, "No, if you don't look for me, you don't realize all the things I do for you, and so you'll see the infinite a loving arm.
That always begins with the same word: stretch.
Anyway.
Because we have to show all the water line of the other, we have to make them see all the problems that should be cured to reproduce our happiness that has kidnapped us.
But the truth is that if this thing is often in good ugly, believing us deeply.
I think about a couple of times, because I'll have a hard life, we can change something, elderly, instead of choosing the node at the base of the relationship, we'll wait for the others to modify them, if the strategy that privileges, when things don't go as you want, is that of impairment and your need.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, is to make us feel like a tool to take the head and put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, there's the fear of facing the conflict that would emerge, that we should show our needs, and then what do we deal with them for the common good?
But in this way we don't even take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity, and we live in the merce of the needs of others.
I remember a young boy, a young boy, a son of separated parents, who, at the end of the first childhood, had learned to distress with great diplomacy between the children of mom and dad.
I hope I hope that when you were openly drawn in the face of one, you would have lost the love of the other, in this limited situation.
I learned important things, for example, in words.
To listen.
To accept, to think about motivations among them, even distant from one from the other, but on the other hand, I've never learned to say no.
But the things they didn't go well didn't learn to say no to the relationships they were going to look for, there were any relationship condition, and, elderly, it was one of those who had to always be media, but in this way they had to end their needs, their desires, their ambitions, they were always underwined the conflict, and they needed to tell you how much.
If the strategy of privileges, when things don't go like you're, it's to suffer your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you, and instead of telling all of you, I'll end up failing.
To wake up.
Thank you very much.
In addition to their needs, or to suffocate them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say, with the means of cause, because I myself, throughout my life, have abused.
I'll tell you what happened to me.
One day, the first hospital I collaborated, sent me to call and said to me.
But Zuccli, here for her, there's no more power.
If we like to continue the collaboration with us, we must accept a transfer.
And I tell myself a far away place, hoping, and detesitated from the most, or if everything would be there to make a job that didn't even enter a big deal with everything I had studied until then.
And then I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, trying to make them change the idea, adopting, but sending that other, and even less because I'd never had to accept a commitment that was unbearable for me.
And then I understood that...
And to get different results, I had to do different things.
For the first time, of course, on my legs, at that moment.
I understood that the secret, to change the others.
It's changing itself.
And if it was changed me?
But also the others would be able to follow, change.
If it was a super brilliant, complete, unique psychologist, the first one wouldn't send me to travel.
If I hadn't done it, things wouldn't take me more than so much.
(Laughter) Let's see, maybe I've been walking through me before I've still got rid of it.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
But the answer didn't go to the other's fault, but I had to introduce myself in the profound of my responsibilities.
Why things?
But they don't change.
We are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do is in the direction of choosing ourselves.
You choose yourself as a cause of things that are not like you want.
You choose yourself as a cause of things that are not like you.
This is our bubble.
But if I never find the work of the crisis, you're putting the only arts to your disposal.
Now we'll find ourselves alone, in the hands, to face something too much bigger, I want to say, "It's the crisis's fault, what do you want to do?"
But if you're part of you, and you think you're perfect, that maybe there's a change mark, then you open doors in front of you, because it defines your responsibility, you do it, then decide to always learn a new language, if you read books, to acquire new skills, to consolidate those that already have, you can work on you to become unique.
Because life is those who do it.
Who doesn't do it?
I got it up.
If inside the copy, things don't go well, you think it's the other to do the first step.
And maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question: What am I sending you a message of inequality, and you're going away, if you are part of you and maybe your best day?
So things change, but they don't change, but they change because you're you who are changing.
Before going to the research of his lacks, now she's looking for her needs and then trying to operate them to satisfy them.
It's in this way that it creates a mental space inside which we can take care of each other instead of making the war.
I don't know, one of those people.
Those who are with everyone, who always have to say yes, one of those people I call, ask me in terms, prostitute and relationships.
It's clear that you're not only losing time, but you also lose the sense of meaning the things you do, if you start yourself, to understand your needs, try to understand which actions you put in the field to preserve them.
So the game becomes something inside which you can become the pattern of the tail.
And starting to work on me, considering myself a cause of the things that didn't go as I wanted: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to understand them that, with my matter, there were practical tools, sometimes fast, to bring great value inside their lives.
But friends, I met with a couple of problems.
Stereotypes, prejudices, psychologist is the doctor of the matters, the psychologist is the doctor of the debts, but I had to talk to a friend, but I went to the park, but what should I do?
I had to lie to myself, or possible that I didn't tell you how much good psychology would have had to change my dream, no, I had to learn to speak a language, which was the one who didn't happen, as close to the object, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, or to listen to their needs, instead of putting mine.
In a short time.
According to this direction?
I've got results for me, unimaginable.
When I finished the collapse with my primary and its transfer, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I didn't know what to do.
So I thought, and in the end I decided, I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as he understood him.
I'm transferred here.
I went home, I killed the computer, and I registered a video I carried on YouTube.
Well, in which I spoke about psychology, here for the chronologist I'm talking about to undertake the anxiety, because maybe you think it's.
(Laughter) In a short time, my YouTube channel has become a reference point in Italy for what psychologists look at in video thanks to this thing every day thousands of people are approaching the psychology to discuss some of the stereotypes I mentioned before.
It was a recognition that the colleagues, at the beginning of a little strange, I'm in 79: I divide psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best schools in Italy, and leave me.
Because, obviously, they saw that my attempt to innovate the profession, the way to communicate it, had something sense, and in Lombardia, I was read to the president's vice-president of the psychologist.
But they don't become reality because, fortunately, or because you've had that.
The theory that must have is the one that keeps moving forward, who doesn't know how it is built and needs to build.
Because the culprit should do it.
It's also so much to discuss your identity, your points of belonging to your certainties, your habits of always, here.
If there's something I learned from all this inner journey.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but also the most urgent.
It must come to our internal, ten motivations asked you a question.
If I had the chance to express a desire, one only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't happen.
What would you change, have we talked about work, physical perspective, the current story?
Well, in fact, I'd like to leave you with a gift, or at least try it, it's a small question that was personally very useful to me.
And that's based on logic that, to get to produce big changes, we have to focus on many small actions.
What's the smallest and simplest thing?
What could you do until now, at the end of the afternoon, to return home after this beautiful newspaper, and that will allow you to take the first step?
To put your life in the direction?
That's where you auspicize.
You can think, "What's the smallest, the simplest thing?"
What can you do to put your life in the direction that environments?
You see, you've chosen the pride to send you.
Oh, ugly, do you leave the pull, right?
But where do you put the bags?
The cinema, "Martetites" are the problems.
Ah, indeed, today I call it.
Or on your feet, what's time to change?
(Video) Life is when my mother arrives.
Do you know something?
The TEDx?
Well, it gave me the chance to talk for eight minutes.
And that's it.
But I want to take this time by myself, here.
I had a dream.
To create a integration band.
Diversity and diversity.
And percussions are so fast.
That's how you can see.
They take the distances and unite the battles.
Are we leaving?
We're lost in seven.
If you were young, I see them, I see the Laura, the Paola, the grandmother, I saw them grow.
Our tests were the marketing.
So the mark was the day of tests.
Where was this stadium entered the Music School of Andreolia?
We took the first bidons, we were together, the first waves together.
Then we decided to become a good mark, from there we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical brands and travels: the first brands, the first brands in the pieces.
And the first satisfaction, the first encounters?
The first satisfaction for the kids, for us, for everything we were doing.
But above all, the first applause.
Unfortunately...
One night of the 20th of 2012, the world fell down.
In the real sense of the word.
All the cases were completely unbearable or crowned: a strong earthquake scope, collected our earths.
And from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of the thousands.
We were all called this.
As I said, the houses were no longer today.
Many crossed: our proof, our place where?
Where there were all the markets, it was completely district.
And the tools were inside.
What did we do?
M.B: I, the Sahara, Marco, Fede, Matteo, we all looked for them.
(Audience) Nevetteine d'Apolis.
And the aircraft?
We were able.
Luckily, we found everything.
We've finished all of us inside a tender, in a tender, in the seventh of Middle Ages.
In that tenderness, there were magnificent things.
We've seen fear sounding stronger.
Because the flag of the fruit sounds stronger than the earthquake.
We looked at ourselves in the eyes, with the Earth that was shaking, to look for a smile, a look.
And the Earth was shaking.
I'm there inside.
We built the first tools.
The scary cests.
They became houses in the bank.
The tubes that have become...
The tools built and suited with ping pong racks, to remove them made with big waves of crowned house.
We were constantly working, always, there was an amazing energy.
Even if we were at a terrible moment.
The inside was born in our first protocol, we decided to put it on a real sponsor.
However, the group's components were increasing, the friends spent the word of 20 that we were, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
But we are part of the construction of the first protocol: the white.
Because it's the white man, because there were the smallest loops, the biggest loops and the white genius.
At that moment, we all moved together as a blank of lights.
Then, immediately after, did we do it?
Last year, we did the high school, the curve.
We became all marine.
Because we really wanted to navigate.
It's also to move for a moment of our Earth.
To breathe for a moment.
Then the year later we made a crack, this marine monster, immediately after.
50 speakers, this flying ship.
And to finish, that of this year, the sea of the Moon, the sea of the Moon.
We wanted to stop a second.
On this Moon, it's looking at the sea.
There were many things inside this tenderness, and none of us would never have thought that a tender could change life.
But we did it.
But I want to tell you something.
The minutes are finishing.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems to me a favola.
It's 150 concerts in turn for the adventure.
The first magician's stage?
GV: The concert in the TV program at home.
Is it the lack of material?
And we really did so many.
And also to me, screaming for the voices, because this is exactly me.
It's exactly the scenery of life.
The fatigue of the sweat, but also of the freshness.
It's a lot of possibilities in the future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality?
Now I have to go back from the fruits, they expect me.
Is there still so much?
And to build.
Thank you all.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Firadini, and in fact I was born as a lawyer, until the moment I asked myself what happened.
In the last 250 years, there are 250 very important years that have radically changed our history and that we live today.
It's about social innovation, and my question is: What is this social innovation?
And above all, our Italy, which is often so biased, is a ready country to incorporate this digital innovation and ready to be tested at the same time of innovation.
This is the digital metaphor, we all take it to us, to us, an object, I believe, almost everyone.
The phone is a technological solution that belongs to the Industrial Revolution.
It's an evolutionary computer, and the computer belongs, instead, to the revolution of the Internet revolution, the Internet phase, our history, and yet.
These three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new time, that we have, in some way, stubbornly, arbitrally in the 2000s, that we are living today.
Let's try to understand then what happened in these 3 in these 250 years, that summarize the industrial revolution, the Internet revolution and the Internet soldiers, and we remember it as a Ferrovia, which is what we've studied.
It was on the school book, in fact, it wasn't just a iron.
We, at the Industrial Revolution, are enormously debated, are enormously debated, for example, because we have the vapor motorcycle, but, for example, that has favored and has resulted much faster, the United States has started to change the modality of manufacture.
And we don't only have the motorcycle.
In vapor, we also need the scope motorcycle, because, on the other hand, it's a Toscana invention and an Italian investment.
The motorcycle has scored.
For example, we need the automobilistic industry: in fact, before the Christmas industry, because the driver was a motorcycle that couldn't go from the farm, when they were able to understand.
It was a motorcycle in terms, when I couldn't understand how to get out of the scent, to make it even true, and it became with the scent that has developed.
The automobilistic industry is everything that has come to us, but not only.
In the Industrial Revolution, we are still in debates, for example, for the phone, the phone is not only with the tool that has allowed us.
To avoid continuing to see our letters and that has speeded the migration of these letters from one part to the other of the world, always more broader than they knew.
But is it also what has allowed us, and has taught us to deposit the caves?
It's under the sea.
And yes, because then the phone couldn't try them in the sea, and then what we were doing, we interrupted everything, no, we went forward, standing on the sea.
The first cavity, to give you a storal dimension, was taken from Italy between medicine and readable.
Not just two populations wake up of agreement, but the first cavity was there.
And we are around 1858.
But there's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know what it is, we use it, brings our voice, in 187900 subscribers to Rome, is only 1877.
Another intention is electrical energy, the first continental Center in Europe was built by Santa Radagonda, where there is the Renaissance, there, a time in 1873 was built in the first electrical central power.
In that year, on December 30th, the scarce was lit.
A part of our history was born exactly from there.
Because it's still in the course, but that has already lived important establishments, and also important emotions from the cultural artistic point of view, but it begins to be born something, to compose something that has never been in the history before: the computer that has at the beginning of the '50s could be in a stadium like this, and they were simply faster, the calculator.
But they went forward and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors, they started to be the artificial intelligences we know.
But in these 50 years of the Internet revolution happened a little more.
There were research institutions, and above all, there were scopes of all the defense.
Those who have brought to develop subterraneous reactions, but not underground because they've taken on the ground, but they won't know because they were not known.
At some point, we decided to open these laws.
And these challenges, called ARPA, the network, became and started to be the World of Web that we know.
There was a diffused, or horizontal system, not hierarchical, extremely captured, capable of bringing information, of gathering information, of generating information, in 1981 there were only 35 million, not many.
Today, it's in the orders of thousands, because we're not talking about the computers we use, but of all these intelligent systems that connect to the network.
But to care about data, to pick up data, or to work for data.
When the mechanical strength, which was made of replaced, that was introduced by industrial revolution.
It started to include the Artificial Intelligence of computers.
And mobility.
And the Internet has had the time we started to live the time we've lived now, the one that's called the Internet, and this second, a phenomenon of creation and creative destruction.
Because I'm essentially an industrial process that tells us.
That what is a new progressively destroyed what is old, because we need to do space, and we will see better then how, but this is the story of the great inventions, but there's a story that is a little more human, that belongs to us a little more, on which I try to make a reflection.
I tried to accompany you.
It was 1863, when, little by little, the Italy hasn't made the Italians yet.
The Minister Mingetti, put in English finances, establishes that the 27th of the Middle Ages, is corresponded to the payment and public dependents.
And from 27 to the next months, what happened?
And at this moment, even if we don't realize it, we are introducing ministers that are producing something extraordinary: before the wealth of a family, more than a singer, was in their ability to produce good services, which were necessary to their own support.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky of the stages, less risky of the elevation, it started in some way to move away from the Earth, and above all.
It has transformed the economic power to be able to produce goods and services in the power of production of one.
Well, the denial.
But there's a second aspect.
Because the fridge is that it's not only that object that frees us from the emergency of going to do the spirit every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to preserve, in a massive way, a healthy way, in quantities of food.
And where does a D?
It gives us the possibility, once again, to focus on something that is not.
Immediately, the use of everyday life.
And this is the man who begins.
To live to the end of 900, these are us.
And in time, how did we say it?
And I arrived at the computer and arrived on the Internet, and then there's a figure that has characterized these years, that is an element.
That we can define how the qualificator of these years: speed, the speed of the challenges, the speed of the movements, the speed of our movement, and we, 25 years ago, weren't fast as we are today, we today, do the speed of our thinking that is not said quality of thinking.
But we are very fast.
But until then something happened.
Typically, it's close when you look at the story, to understand the passengers from one century to the other, and sharing data that are not necessarily zero.
In 1900, 1900, 2000, when we can say that it's finished the 20th century, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two data that is significantly segregated from a time to another, 2001 and 2001.
First of all.
So the American economy started to slow down, and on the other hand, there were Torri Gemelli, and so something in balance has started to change, these balances that seemed solid, we realized that they were very fragile.
But we went forward until there was something that has slowed all the environment, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world, the oriental world together, had never met.
But there's not only America to have slowed, almost closed, there was also the orientation.
But there were European states that were to fail.
The Greek was already in the leaves of failure, they don't talk to us, but still there.
And it changed something.
And he said, "But what has changed, the economic paradigm has changed, we couldn't."
Not to wait for the biggest economic crisis that, in fact, was verified in 2008 and was crazy not to think about it, but how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension?
When can we do everything?
With many less people.
It was obvious that it would have happened: we were blind, we didn't know how to wait, look at these companies.
These companies are stable multinationalities, in their majority, but above all, they are all companies that are Dante after 2011.
What did these companies do not innovate inventing something, they didn't innovate building something that wasn't there before, but they started to do what we've always done to buy and sell, to learn?
Learn.
The different way, the most efficient way.
In Italy, the Italy often denied, we try to look at the state of absolute and digital Italy, according to five factors, connectivity.
We're ten percentual points under the media, but honestly, we're almost close to a fast connection for 50 percent, and so much is little.
There's still something: according to human skills, human resources, competences of curving it, of a different being between advanced and basic skills and basic skills, those that allow us to develop.
A third picture we have to look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it, a third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of the digital future in productive processes.
So the business, or the industrialization of products and services, the fifth or the digitalization.
The system of public administration: we immediately choose the field of some ambiguity, and we keep the only two that are important: especially a good news for everyone, all the five elements that are increased, are all the five elements that are in a growth, in a growth speed, completely in at the end of two years.
We're aligning European countries, and this doesn't want news, on the other hand, with activity, we've said it without ten points out.
But, specifically, it's enough to look at the newspapers and see who.
We're growing fast, there are new in exchange between new operators, new competitions: we're building a very important and competitive tissue, the use of internal, and we're really seconds a little.
In fact, a very profound change is born to the European standards.
There are two factors that we have to look at with great attention that will be key for our future of countries, and they are the skills and the inclusion of digital in brutal factors.
And in this, we have two engines: the first motorcycle is what made the Italy in the '50, 60s, they are the small companies.
Long from being, the small media, something not useful, not effective, not paragonable to large multinationals, in fact.
They're probably the entrepreneurial tool, the most effective to interceive the speed of change: they're agile, they're speeds, they're small, they know how to do something extraordinary that is the Made in Italy, the production of products.
That it's pretty unique in their DNA, everyone wants it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, competences inside these realities, because these realities can become the multinationalities that we talk about Financial Times.
In other words, those multinationals that can help.
A internal segment of the market, in an extraordinary way, generating wealth for the whole tissue that is around you: a heritage that, for her nature, for her natural nature, and this is the first assault that we have, the first great motorcycle, we can't digitalize the crop.
But is it possible?
That tourists visit only three cities: Venezuela, Firences, Rome, and then meet, but the richness of these three cities don't make the wealth of our country.
And we're learning, maybe we've tried to start, but we're fast to recover, to include this heritage.
In a knowledge system that allows us to carry it and enjoy it, to make it notice, and to bring tourism not only to visit three centers, but to visit all our country, I believe that this is the great need that we can do in our Italy: Great.
And he told me.
I'd talk about it in a certain sense and the opposite action of the word.
What does all this mean?
Our encounter is the opposite of the word "share," because I'll talk not about sharing, but in a certain sense of the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'll talk about inequality, I'd like to start first.
With a question: According to you, in the last 15, 20 years, we say, in the 21st century, inequalities in the world, the inequalities between the citizens of the world are increased or are decreased?
But I believe most of you will answer, "I'm increased, if you were the journalists, maybe you'll reach the precious goal, they're increased in a exponential way, and if I asked you, "What about it?"
But maybe the answer of many would be.
Also.
I asked myself these questions in the last few years.
And with the only 24th and the foundation of video, I prepared.
(Laughter) With my colleagues, a report.
In inequalities, from when they are artists, that is, financially, from 1960 to the majority of the countries in the world.
Audience: Yes.
But the result is what you see.
This is the curve of the development of inequality, directly between the citizens of the world, as you can see, there was indeed an increase of inequalities, especially in the 80s, but from now on.
And from the end of the last century, at the end of the '90s, the compessive inequality between the citizens of the world is crowned and precipitated, now we are at the worst storage.
GV: In Italy?
In other words, inequalities are quite complicated, even here we have an increase throughout the 80s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second public.
AC: We have a trend of inequality of growth.
And how can we read these data?
Well, a possible reading is to say, "We've traveled a collective bathroom because we continue to talk about years of argument of inequality, how much data is not supposedly in this reading."
But we could also ask ourselves another question: What if the feeling of an increase of inequalities that many of us have the same?
Let's go!
(Laughter) It wasn't wrong the feeling, but it was wrong the idea of inequality in which we think about.
AD: Perhaps.
We must reflect on the issue of inequality, on what we understand, for inequality, maybe the concept of inequality requires some rethink.
(Laughter) Let's leave temporary in suspicious this question and ask ourselves about a century.
It's also a place: we move to Cambridge in 1928, a year before the great Church of 29: Lickens.
It was Cambridge, a discourse pronounces.
Let's move forward.
But it has a student audience, a speech became then famous with the title "Posibility Economic for our grandchildren," in that occasion, Keynes forms two professions: the first says.
It's a century, productivity.
So, from a worker, it will be eight times the one of today, that is 1928.
And this trade, in fact, is made because if you went to take it.
There are the reconstructions of the stories of the economy.
Indeed, most of the advanced society, we have an increase of productivity in the turn of 100 years, that even 10 to 12 times, so this teacher has been achieved.
But from this teacher Keynes also needed a consequence, an idea, that is, humanity.
So, little by little, that is, it's done to say a little to 100 years.
It would be found with a huge amount of free time that would have taken it to work less.
And he also said, to work everyone, and when he said less, he understood a week of 15 hours of work.
I have a three-hour work time a day.
And he saw a problem for this, because the question that was asked Keynes, but with all this free time we knew how to use it well or not.
AD: Well.
Apparently, this second thirsty hasn't been made.
(Laughter) Because we all see it, that we don't all work, and it doesn't seem exactly what we work three hours a day.
I'll show you that this teacher is divided in two parts, there's one that says we'll all work, it's certainly false.
But the first part we'll work a lot less, we'll work three hours a day, we're sure it's not done anywhere, we'll see what happened in Italy.
That's it.
Kurva or this trajectory represents.
But what is time fraction?
That an Italian means to work throughout his life, its life naturally potentially working, that is, for the 15 years, then when we are able to compare a job, well, if we look at this trajectory.
Keynes's teacher was actually made, because we were at the beginning of 900, almost 40% of our lives's time.
To work, and now we look for 16% and the interesting thing is that this 16%.
It's two hours and a fourth a day, that is, the barrier of the three hours we've already screwed it in Italy.
Naturally.
Well, if this happened, there are also ears and banals.
For example, there's another very positive reason: the old age is enormously aligned because we die very soon, the life expectancy is the one who decides something like 27 years, from the beginning of the last century, from 900.
QD: Our children often study, study long, even at 25 and 30 years old, so the youth has also gotten.
But there's a more fundamental reason why.
KA: Our quote of time?
I dedicated to work and believed.
And it's the test of occupation, that is, the number of people who work.
This is the historical series of total occupation.
It's built for this occasion and this dramatic series, because it makes you see, okay?
In the beginning of the century, in all monarchical era.
Before the Second World War, the occupation rate was even better than 70%.
AC: Today.
We're very low, we're around 50% scarce, elderly.
So from 1968 and except one year, the occupation rate has always been inferior to 50%.
But a rate of inferior occupation to 50 percent, what does it mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, who don't work, that is, pure consumers who don't perceive any network.
There are more workers.
But, in front of this?
That's it.
Storical.
AC: We can also have a reaction.
But it's enthusiastic and say.
But what is this?
And progress, beauty, and modernity, things went like that because we can allow it.
But then, let's see if, in the country that the problem of modernity, that is in the United States, things went in the same way, because if this interpretation is fair, it should have happened in the United States, and then we see the confrontation.
Italy.
And the United States.
AC: This is the storal series of time.
It's dedicated to work in life, as you can see, in the United States, it's only up to the 30s, then it's established, and it's a lighter tendency to the increase while we believe it, but even more impressive, and the storage series of the occupation rate.
There's an increase, that small one you see below is the crisis of the 29th, we have a general tendency of the occupation rate in the United States.
At the increase, instead, in our case, we have a situation of reduction.
Well, the occupation task.
But then, this is a pathology.
Well, it's not normal.
Okay.
There are more people who consume without producing than the people who produce.
But it's not normal that the majority of the population lives in a condition that I'll define.
A parasitary dependency, dependency, because it depends on the network you are.
This, you can also be a family, the State.
But it's parassitary because I consume, I have the right to available without working.
I have a friend who does it.
Theater was theater, when did I find these results?
We were at the end of the eye.
And you, how would you represent this situation with an image, a situation of parasitary dependence, and you know what answered to me?
With the hypothesis, it's that light that lives on the spots of the hypothesis, but it's called buffag, some say buffaga, here it is.
If you want to have an idea of how you behave.
The bubble or the bubble on the prototype, or on the other big mammals, and these fish also live on the broken rivers, on the bubbles, well, we have this thread.
The one that will treat us for a second, in which you can see.
[A.DE.]
What about these fish?
How do they live?
Speaking of the resources that the bubble provides, which are insects.
The tree means that everything that's on the edge of the bubble is not clear if the bubble is contained, that eye that can mean that it's playing, it's that it's bothered by the light, even if it's.
This is what happens in nature, but I'm not an ethologist, I do the sociologist, so the question I asked myself as a sociologist.
It's another.
AC: How can we define a situation of this kind, how do we define a society where there is a majority of pure consumers?
There's this kind of productive consumption, the first one, there for them, said to me, "But this is the ignorant society?"
And society, gentlemen, like the feudal society, in which there's a ceiling that has put in the condition of living without working.
But, naturally, it's not enough: you have to add a qualification.
Well, this is indeed a condition.
That it could be defined by ignorant society, but it's a mass society.
Audience: Yes!
Because consumers are more producers.
Well, in society it's simple, classic: we have the gentleman and the serves of the globe that produce for him.
Well, in society, the clear report is a relationship of commanding and subtomission: in mass security, things are a little more complicated, gentlemen have become many.
"Yes."
The relationship between the signs and the producers is much more complicated: Greek Dubezon, a great psychologist anthropologist, would have defined a relationship of Oppio Legame, we see why.
KA: The relationship?
The bubble with the hypothesis is parassitism, and this is a advantage signed in green, but it's also dependence, because it depends on food that's in it.
It's the backpack of the helicop.
The nurse indicates one.
A disadvantage.
And also from the point of view of producers, we have, again, a red fresh, a green light, the autonomous hypothesis doesn't need bubble, but it's, in some way, in a reaction of obligation, as we are, in the face of color we maintain, because we can't have the hypothesis.
So, not nourishing the fish that live on their spices, so the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of legacy, but a situation.
That's not fine.
Is it a situation in which?
Audience: Yes.
A new problem of inequality, and now we get there.
This is the question I had asked myself about Keynes: today, maybe, is the real inequality?
And the inequality of access to work.
The access to work is very asimeteric in our social system, but if inequality is access to work we can use tools.
In the analysis of inequality, that is to calculate an efficient concentration of genius, which is the tool with which.
And if we measure inequality, we can apply it to work: there are people who don't work, who have a job, who have two jobs.
And the position of the adventure, in this scale, of inequality, of access to work, is dramatic.
(Laughter) The position of the History is to be penitimate in the graduation together.
And it's Turkey.
The country in which inequality reaches the maximum one simply because there is the exclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, we would probably have the palm of this creator.
It's the best situation, the one of the northwest.
With the United States, I was in the middle.
Do they miss us?
To become an Ox and normal country, seven million jobs positions.
But how did we get to this, this is the story?
For the inequality of access to work in Italy, it's always measured in any kind of genius, you can see something clamorous that inequality is the minimum during the monarchical age, especially under the faster.
And it's massive in the public age, especially under the second public that is the one we live in.
They lack us seven million jobs, if we had seven million jobs in more, our families.
And they would perceive 1,000 euro a month, in more, we would have 12,000 euros of income in more.
In the year, and our state would have 150 billion euros to spend as much as they cost the health and the school put together, more or less in Italy.
Audience: Yes.
It's here, concluded.
But there's one.
Audience: No.
But we have the scholarship to write.
In the first article of the Constitution, the History is a democratic Republic based on work: we are the only country.
That has this in the first title of the Constitution, and we are the worst country together with Turkey.
The West.
That's it.
But we change things.
We believe it.
There are 7 million jobs that lack, or maybe better to cancel the article one of the Constitution.
Because, being so, things sound like a BFP.
Thank you.
