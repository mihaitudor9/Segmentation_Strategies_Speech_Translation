In 2016, I was given a award from the birth to the confrontation of the students, and my ability to create less formal data environments, more relaxing, let's imagine that this is a classic music, and first ten minutes, when students enter and get there.
(Laughter) During my lessons, I use a method used at the end of the old age.
Storietelling.
(Laughter) The pedagogical level, the storytelling is a method based on the use of narratives to transmit knowledge to students, and just with this method that I'd like to start by explaining you a topic about everyone's mouth.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that children tell, I'd like to start my story once.
Second world war: 1942, the UK region.
Blockchain Park, a northern residence of London.
There was a young, 30 years old.
Alan Turing.
Listen to Laureal King's College of Cambridge, and they get a research doctor in logic, the Princeton University in America.
In that period, the Tedes used a special and enigma machine.
It was a machine to write.
The workers digitalized details, but as soon as stuck on a paper those letters, they stuck other letters, according to a code imposed mechanically under the machine: to communicate between them.
But anyone would take this paper in front of you without any sense.
It was shouting.
Alan Turing was one of the main paintings in Blece Park, was one of the main figures.
What can you see?
On the other hand, able to decipher these TEDx's writing tests.
For this invention, we think that war is finished with two years of anticipation.
It's saving many human quickly.
Alan Turing continues after the war to do its logical research.
And it's considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
With your Turing machine, he formalizes the concept of computer, even before the computer was created in practice.
In 1950, an article published on the "Manda" magazine, "Computing Machine and Intelligence," where Test Twing proposes.
But the question behind the testing is a very precise.
They can think machines.
From here on, artificial intelligence began.
Thank you.
Probably many of you have seen the film of the "Mitates and a game," the game of limitation, I want to explain to you.
But do we suppose there's a person here?
The request is to be the computer.
And on the other hand, a machine that asks questions and on the other hand, a machine M is an operator.
Thank you.
In an alternative way, the machine M and the speaker or form the answers to the person standing.
It's said that the machine takes over that Testituring if the person is not able to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the operator, this is the game limit.
The machine must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies, it must interpret the natural language.
The question that comes from the person must represent knowledge to form the answers, to think in an automatic way to form these answers.
And it must learn automatically.
Thank you.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence: one of these is cognitive approach.
But it's based on human thinking.
According to this process, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to capture thinking.
In the moment they are born.
Or we try to modify the thinking at a psychological level.
That's why artificial intelligence is said that if we can really have a fedal representation of human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of the laws of rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man?
All the men are mortal.
Socrates are mortal.
This is a deductive argument.
There are two primary legs: it's trying to build educational arguments and get them into a machine, according to the approach of thinking laws, from here the logic is born.
Another approach is the approach of rational agents.
A rational agent, an entity.
(Laughter) It must act.
It must be adapted to the context.
And it must be carried out goals, and know how to take them to end.
And it must act in a rational way.
So we can say, we can create a machine, so the Turing test is linked to intelligent people, reformulating the Turing phrase, a machine to think.
An artificial agent.
I'm able to think.
To exhibit intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence, so it's the purpose of creating artificial entities, intelligent, your phone is an entity.
Among the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence as psychological construct, once we have more knowledge.
That's it.
In fact, we try to build intelligent identity and support humans, it's a cycle.
But let's see today: we have subtle agents, human beings, sovereign people, I would like to use five classes to classify artificial agents according to their abilities, if machines can think.
Very human, and finally we have optimal agents.
I want to explain to you with some examples: optimal agents are the agents that solve the cube of Rubik, already with a four-year-old person in the best way, play a sad, think that a few years ago a young man gave the start of the cube of Rubik, which is resolved in 4.73 seconds.
And do we have the sovereign agents?
Do they act better than all people?
For example, in the game of the rocks, in the game of the scarce.
A few years ago, the Russian Russian Campion of Skakis, Gaspora, fought by an artificial agent, we have the people who work almost like all people, for example in the game of the Texano, to answer the question of the kitchen.
We used to anticipate the man.
Who act?
Almost like all people.
For example, in cognitive activities like the crowned words, or the classification of images, and in the end we have subtle people who manage the worst of all people, for example, are the classification of objects.
The recognition of caligraphy, the vocal recognition, the translation of a language to the other.
But if there's something that artificial agents, today, are not able to do, for example, is a disambiguation, we're talking about the result.
How?
Now, in the future, a few years ago, in America, it was introduced a thing from the name of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest artificial intelligences in the world, these today are the greatest limits of artificial intelligence, so we think that we are far from the world's line.
Imagine a line that indicates the human intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a red line that indicates the machine intelligence with an exponential attitude: this moment follows the pregnancy in the wall's leg, so the computer complexity, for example, measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, radiated in two years and in four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to...
To make this compassionate compassionate compound to reduce the human brain: I didn't have it, in 2020 we would have access to 1,000 dolls to this computer capacity.
(End of video) In 2025, secondary and crossed, I'll never be able to get rid of our brain in a precise way.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will spend the test, they will overcome the test.
That's it.
And then, in 2045, and the indication of the moment it will have the technological singularity.
In which machines will follow the intelligence of the machines and will follow an exponential environment that will radically change human intelligence.
So, in his article.
It's published on the "Mind" magazine, Turing not only proposed its test, but it also proposes new objections against its same test, these objections are us, but also against artificial intelligence.
A few years ago, I was a student at the University of Varese, I followed a course of ethical ethology and ethics of computer science, had by the Gaithan professor Aurélio Lanzerone, one of the compounds we had to move against artificial intelligence.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine that is simply overwhelmed, we suppose to take the intelligence of all people, to put the seed, a symbol of summer to the minister side of the equations, so we obtain an intelligence equality.
But if it's true that we were able to transfer our intelligence inside a machine, and this becomes more intelligent than us?
It's true that we left the machine to become more intelligent than us.
So, to conclude my story, by letting myself to the initial question, you can think, "I'd like to leave you with a open question."
(Audience) Yes.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
How many of you today have taken pictures?
Thank you.
OK, well, this gives me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in the bathroom, and it all saves me the creative director of a study that takes care of photography, and it's a person who has taken so many photos with their phone, which doesn't do absolutely me in a photographer, I've spent the last three years.
This is me, immersed among my maps, to take care of a liquid matter: the photography, which is the product and broadcast through the cell phone.
Her limits, her contradictions, her potentialities, her impact on the market, her projectual and self-esteem, to find answers to these questions, I've tried to understand the photographer's mobile model that changes while we're here to discuss, this is only one of the questions I've tried to open a confrontation.
With photographers, careers, criticisms, theories that have embraced the challenge of this new means, I asked them to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the successes, of their shared and images through the cell phone.
To find answers, I looked around me.
And I arrived in New York.
At the DSC of the photo editor of New York Times Magazing, in Cathy Ryan.
In Berlin, in the AIM sede, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock.
In Parigi.
In the "Parifotto" room, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world, to enter those places in which photography is distributed and is based on how the photographer changes these engratulations.
To find answers, I tried to look beyond the surface of the great common places of the contemporary.
The selfie, for example, the selfie to get involved, simply to a delirium narcissive as some psychologists have sustained with the body dismorphism of body dismorphism, and to put themselves in connection as some psychologists have sustained with the occupational basics of the generation of the millennials, as "Key Darwin."
Or the Asho Lager, the victim designed by my photographic experiments, because, unfortunately, the result of a world's world's worldwide epidemic, or, instead, as it has sustained the social society, history, history, even for us to understand what we are.
And how are we?
But the story of Mobile photography is short, but in a few years I've invented millions and millions of people.
A new code that exceeds every linguistic barrier, used daily to communicate, testify themselves, to feed a constant flow of images that put in communication the individuals of an angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collective world, if you want, that has impressive numbers: every two minutes, today, we scat more images of how many humanicans have been taken in the burden of 100th century.
More than 350 million of these images are carried every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production and the diffusion of images, of activities that, until a few years ago, looked at a research collection of professionals, became an instinct of the action of our daily experience.
A form of social interaction, a channel of proof of our private sphere in the public dimension, in which we define ourselves through the images we produce, or better, we exist because we produce images.
And if the photographer is a new language, then it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that is still strongly drawn by that process of liquidity that affects them daily, like the team of a modernity, the work, the family, the coppy, are always more fascinating, and here actors are unstably points in a universe, which is composed of compounds.
It's constantly based on the instant gratification of our shared need.
But in a world where each one, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone.
That the rule remains the professional photographer and that differences pass through accidental and conscious photographs.
On the one hand, the facility of using the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing professionals the universal language.
Forting to fulfill that process of democratization of photography, I started with Lera Kodak and arrived until the iPhone.
On the other hand.
The use of cell phone as a reward tool offered to professional photographers.
Nine possibilities in approach to stories, the contents, the subjects.
Still, on one hand, the opening to all of us, of a dialogue channel, with a potentially global audience, has moved the professional photographer of its exclusive void as a producer of images.
It has put them in crisis the social function, the economic position.
It's enough to think of the rule that has had the photographer and social network, in the first Arabic, showing that it's a powerful tool to orient public opinion and a machine that is hardly controlled by the kings, this is a picture dedicated to the rule of the photographer in the first Arabic, on the other hand.
Let's think that the possibility of interaction is direct through the web, through Instagram, between the photographer and the audience, has liberated it from the impossibility of reaching the destinations of their own message if it has not through traditional channels, like measures, daily, galleries, of access and limited resources.
And he allowed them to put themselves directly in the use of the news, vehicking content in real time, a particularly interesting example.
Like, for example, six female photos, an Instagram account based on a American photographer, Rayce, Kur Niss, dedicated to the conservation of the universal heritage of the family to the time of the photographer's memory that has had origin after this experiment.
Nine paths of curatory selection, like 14 -1500 Bilfotographers, one of those with a great consistence of Italian photographers, Giulio Napolitan and George Poswick, through the iPhone, created by this tool with a great consciousness.
Benjamin Loui.
Now, a life that has used and use the smartphone of conflicts, showing how the agility and the description of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of deepness.
Photography as a cup that belongs to a simple smartphone has explored new paths for Newsmaking, creating a well-being platform to put in touch the American soldiers in the south of Afghanistan with their families, and to create a motor of information from the front of the first hand.
Bred Mengin, who used it for Sport's photography, exclusive territory of photographers with hyper-performant appearances, and made a vehicle of intimate narration and minimal narration on the best Leag of Baisbol.
Research Cirnandt, who enjoyed the discretion and manner for the photographer, creating a very personalistic aesthetics.
Radiròi, who made a genuine vehicle, going back to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, and creating a community that attacks the parts around his job.
MTIC that uses it daily to build its family album, by putting a reflection on how Instagram changes the facts of our privacy, and the way we build and preserve our visual memory.
Peter of Campo, who, through the Countain Ever of Africa, dedicated to the story of a daily and normal Africa, from there to the media stereotypes, of accidental matters, on the crisis and on the fame, has shown how the photographer lights to also be used to discuss the photovoltaic stereotypes.
Like Stephan of Luigi who interpreted the Omer's story with the cell phone, telling in the AI series, one of the oldest heritage of the history of the West, with the new vision tool.
Or like Anastasia Taylor Linde, who photographed the protests in Piazza, who, during the protests of Mai-Dan, with a beautiful poetry abroad, the moment in which the lab of the bronics is born and is born the image, translated and contemporary.
Well, what do these photographs know how to do?
To tell, going to the outskirts of action, or looking for personalized tags on the event, to avoid more than recording.
Creating images that are never straightened to reality, but that are born from a deep interaction between photographer and content to be broadcast on different platforms and reach different audiences.
To make network using the connections in an innovative way.
Putting on the authority exercise for their point of view on the world and the quality of deepness.
Because anyway, it's the tool that's predicted: only if the conceptuality of photography is smiled by a solid, articulated and powerful writing.
It can be distinguished from the visible rumor of the bottom that offers us the eyes.
All of this, I believe, makes the difference between a photograph that was reinforced of the real, its bullying, reproduction, its reference and sharing.
And a photograph that, in reality, can still be a cultural metaphor.
Thank you all.
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
What we believe is to be silence.
Actually, there are 50 "erts" of black race.
There are 50 thirds that are immediately entered in our lives.
We wake up from the illusion that silence exists.
"Oh, but...
There is no.
So in this room, those providers, these smooths, then you imagine yourself, go home after a work day, really stressful.
Imagine your partner, your partner, and then you'll get into the bubble of your bed camera and think you're alone, but no.
There's always her, this frequency of 50 Airz, which I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible, in our cases, in our lives, but it's more or less this sound.
Now, we have a positive aspect, or better, first of the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist, but we have a positive aspect.
We're never alone, that is, this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us, really, paranoid.
And if we look at it as a drawing, this frequency of 50 Ears is nothing more than a sound wave, a wave with a beautiful rich spectrum, with which we can make music, and then I asked myself, "But why?
Why not make us music?
So, I'm a composer of sound colonies, an artist, I'm now a little special, because I'm complicated life deciding to make music alone and exclusively through rumor.
My parents divorced when I was a child, and I know you think this is the classic story of Strappalacre, but, instead, it was the revelation of my life, so every complement of the network was no longer.
A classic complement of network, closed, immobile, before voice, but it becomes my musical tool.
With a joy among the other of my mom, who every roof didn't find the bikes, among the other man, Macciao, was looking at me from the streaming, which is a great freedom.
Of course, at some point I tried to become a normal person, trying to say.
I tried because I started studying Chitarra.
It's a strong piano.
Then I liked Woody Allen, so I started to create the grandson, the problem I really liked Arenzo Arvor, who wrote a badly ambitious song in Bigo, was coming like the first years of study in Genova.
But I didn't even abandon Clarinetto.
It's just like that, not to go like that.
It's easy to illusion my classmates.
But why did I abandon all this, why did I study and escape from that notation so rigid?
Because there's more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more sponsor in a rumor, and I like to paragonate it to the problems of life.
All of us have attacked a rumor, a failure, something that made us think, but I'm sure that that this rumor made us grow much more.
From a smile.
So, what is my mission?
When I'm a child, it's to transform a failure, a rumor in music, and harmonize everything around me.
Let's go.
I would have been able, right?
I say, "Let's make a beautiful turning point of dollar, Gino Paoli," and everything would be concluded, but no, I'm complicated in this way life.
What is it?
The sound.
But above all!
What is the study, and with the saying, is one of the most difficult senses to understand, but also the most immediate, the most powerful.
To transmit an emotion: our inner eye, the protein of the oceans, our team, reaches the maximum functionality around the fifth week of gesture.
I say this week of gesture, this means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to listen even before seeing, and this is not a case.
Because the fact must be ready.
I know that the sponsor in life, once born, must be ready to the dark text, it shouldn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So, in a case, if the mother, during the pregnancy, listened to Panchroco British, hasn't been stupid if the child, once was born, will be sleeping, listening, for example, Sex Pistols, so the future Mom prevents you, and it's a richness that I personally pay attention to the musical choice, attention to the trap, more than another ... OK?
(Applause) But what is sound: sound is everything we're surrounded, the sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what, in our lives, is completely scared.
You don't see, you don't touch.
But the colony is time for every day, the retirements with our partner, the mother who screams us, because the mother screams us, still, always.
All of this is the sound colony of our days.
"Yes."
Of course, the visual is much easier.
We don't know.
The visual is when we enter the system's hair, we say.
It's smaller than how I imagined them.
There's more small than what, more small than the man of Milan.
The smaller than San Pietro.
"Are you smaller at home, maybe?"
That's it.
And you understand the same thing as when a person sees me in video, or on stage, and then I meet people and says to me, "I imagined higher, of course, because it would be really impossible."
Going from this budget, the visual ...
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's imagine our lives, I'd like to genuine your ability to observe, so we're in vacation.
We're in the sea, not in case, and we start to take pictures of feet, in the wise, then the kilometers are not, I've lost the tone, but it's a lot of money, because I have to take a lot of photos: well, I have a blog of food, it's not true.
Food, and ...
No one sees the doll.
We photograph it.
And we look at it.
We make many videos, but we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I teach you a trick: when you connect with someone?
The best moment to know the person is to stay in silence, that silence that, among the other, doesn't exist: go for two.
To listen.
Close yourself and listen.
Like in this moment.
So, today I'd like to take you with me, I'd like to bring you with me.
Still for the world, I was evolving it.
It's your perception of listening.
And I'd like to start by telling you...
The dream of my life, the dream of my life that is born from school.
It's about myself.
It was 2013, I wanted to run away from the History for the first time, the listening of myself, a series of failures, problems and others.
I've later turned into harmony, but I'm trying to look for a very far place in Italy, so I decided to choose.
A city on the Atlantic.
There was the Atlantis, yes, it's true.
There was still a lot, I decided to participate in a competition, I came to an artistic residence, I started the most beautiful years of my life, for a simple fact that, for the first time, I was listening to myself.
So, I didn't have money, I had so much fear: I had an idea, but I was the only one to believe us, and it was the one that would have listened to the sounds of the whole world, of all the cities of the world, creating for each city, calling this project "Sound of Syria."
And I'd like to take you to this moment to Shanghai, where for 48 hours, I'm not registered, his purposes of the city.
And I created a sound colony.
So, at this moment?
I want to sound: Shanghai.
You were still focused on the visual, and this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test, it's all collected to the visual.
Now.
There's a city that is sure, you've photographed in every way, and you're asked more than once, but that smoke that comes from the tombs that are made, but the bridge of Brooklyn is an exceptional exylophone.
Everything completely online.
And I want to add it to the other.
Or the Counter, who is really touched on the side, is something very important to say.
Hello, beautiful, but it's not beautiful because of the other part of the world.
It's not magical because it's on the other hand, it's magical because under our eyes every day.
And maybe many of you know a pair of places.
In this picture?
The sound rule is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, going around a city, losing yourself in the same city, well, I knew Genova.
I knew Genova because there were many times, there were absolutely captured many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that, among my favorite cities, now, scaven the applause, I prepare you.
I started to record the first sounds, and the first sounds were given to these children, that in this tube of an important iron, gave me this audio camp.
And I'll make you feel, before the Greek camp, and then, that's worked.
But now, what's the lab?
I said, "No.
Great, left to the aircraft.
And I like a bit - I've always done it - that I'm not normal, I've never been - I've attacked this beautiful, and it has restricted me a very low frequency that has become a synthesiser.
Whether we are right.
I'm in the lab.
Of course, Genova is "Mor Zandis" (Laughter) and I wasn't born, this is a serious thing, in every way.
The writing, which you see constantly in the beach of Ferrari, is not just a writer, for me it's a great musical tool, and helped me to support the sound of this colony.
It's more or less like that.
But the last sound, after I really want to sound like Genova, is that of...
All the doors of the port.
That we are used to look at, but the sound is a perception that is opposed to the view, and so I created this microphone.
I immersed it for 48 hours.
I found a sound of a track that gave me a particular frequency that became melody, and when it became the melody, it's because putting it in the loop is transformed into what the important voice of the colony is gold.
This is its rock and roll.
It's true.
Well, now I wanted to make you feel Genova, but I came to this point, "No.
Here's Genova as a sound.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
(Laughter) It's almost the sound of our passions in my and your passions, and for how many people will tell you that they're rumorous, they're stuck outside time, you really want to listen to them, and I'll always bring you to school, thank you!
As it's said Guybek in Italian, the word usually uses restitution is not perfect, but it's the idea, in general, the idea of restitution linked to monetary institution to beneficence, many times, instead, the restitution is linked to restricting what you've done, what you've learned.
And passing from the end of the '90s, in 1999, precisely, this is my son's gesture.
Most of them had these extraordinary effort to the reward, next to you, and it was a very heavy activity made with many parents, some of them said, "No, why should we help, we have to think the common state, but most of them were my wife who organized the collection to pay the material of the asy?
To help the asylum, to help the community, a million and 200,000 readers, because they don't remember 600 euros from then on, and it was one of the efforts of individuals in an extraordinary effort.
A few months later, we take the United States, this is now.
It's similar: the same similar school for a close school, this is the biggest child.
And there's a completely different reality, which was extraordinary for us, we realize that it's a totally ordinary reality.
In other words, the thing of the "giveback" of the restitution is very normal.
I said this, the concept of restitution has had fortune, and then there are also the mechanisms, there was fishing lucidity, there are processes, it works, it's based on this, so the extraordinary effort for all society.
I'm ten years old, some of you may have known it, this is the south's launch.
It has supported the famous "Obama Ker," at the time, so it's called "System is the moment," Obama lances the famous bank or Bamakia, and there was an incredible technological debate.
These things don't happen only in Italy, they build a site that doesn't work for a few days, but then someone has stopped criticizing, which is easy and normal to try to do and help, which is difficult, extraordinary, technological launch, they have been 100 million dolls, so it's not worried about these things that don't happen only in Italy.
(Audience) Yes.
This is Time Magazine's coverage.
After that, many would have criticized the experts of technologies sent by Google and other companies, they were offered, and I agree with the Bianca house, I didn't have the session, I stayed in a few weeks, at a decade of the costs.
The extraordinary effort, and not the ordinary, I've seen that they've finished in the company's coverage, was very interesting, and it's what I want to explain from what was spinning, I'm spinning from people who haven't learned their lives, and experiences that, in this case.
So they are these models that are part of this bag, that we need to use, we want to reproduce, I want to talk about the word "models," because one also implies the ability to manage big technological systems, complex, unbearable, repeated systems, but also the factory.
Almost 20 years ago from the History, the idea of helping was also because I'm Italian and ...
I wanted to do it: do or not do it, there's no attempt, maybe it's in Italian, it's to do or not only to criticize.
Audience: Yes!
In general, in those things that have already drawn us a little less, a few years later we're five, we're against San Francisco, and the Visica's window has become valuable, we're aware of the need of the transformation in general.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of processes, for the digital transformation of the public administration, asks me why it doesn't come to help us in Italy for a couple of years, I think it's reflected in my wife's pavement, Monica, and I talk to my genius, to get the brief, I decided to apply it, and I didn't get it, and I didn't get to the Rome for two years.
A topic of...
- Ah, Amazon.
But those who have to do it, Molina Amazon, Probono, Maiday, something will give you underwater, these are only many of the phrases, and I have to say that we've also received so much support, so at this moment we're focusing on this part, but there's a positive part, there's been, I was mentally prepared to the sketchism and to the bubble of people to ask me, but to wait for these forests, and yes, I didn't expect it, of course.
But the scientist doesn't often have the cinism that characterizes you a certain mentality, it will never make the sense of common good, of doing things because you think of helping, of improving a situation not only because it doesn't matter to us.
And here's where, for the days of you, this is a commissioner, for the most elderly you recognize it, as an extraordinary commission, I simply say, because it's the rule that allowed me to become, in this way, we want to transform them with people who come from the public administration, here you can see the post that I had done when I was born.
So I've put myself in the idea, but how do I convince someone to do the same thing I'm doing here, among the other, maybe some of you recognize it, that blank photography of the mining of the beautiful, that in the '47s has changed all the United States, in this massive sport, of investment and infrastructure?
(Laughter) We created the vision that the operative system of the country is a series of fundamental components that can build simpler services for citizens, the public administration and companies, a very beautiful and blood vision.
I continued in my place, the soccer field in Salita, since the American soccer, if I don't make mistakes.
And I continued, we'll also have many rules, complicated, sometimes incomprehensible, it's a easy prediction: we should learn to manage with intelligence and bureaucracy, many of them will not understand how public administration works, they've already talked to us in many, they've failed in Italy, it doesn't work like that.
Those of the second kind, as they want to defend the status quo and prejudices, the criticisms of the first type will come from people who really want to offer their contribution, and we've found many of them, we'll get many criticisms, some comments will be useful and others will always be genuine.
Or that, simply, they've been taught to the power, and this is our problem: to bring things that don't work.
Let's do it.
Remember this image: the first, men and women on the cover of Time Magazine.
Here's it: so, despite trying to scor the most possible people to do with the eye, I received about three,000 questions, and we immediately started to operate, what do we do?
(Laughter) In fact, we take care of Draulica.
These are the tubes of the administration public, some of them to do a lot about connecting, because the big problem is that the systems, the applications, anything that should be interconnected is "assylos" in not connecting.
And I'm not only talking about machine-machine, I'm also talking about people who don't want to explore their own data and their own applications, so it's about introducing the concept, writing it, explaining it, and in years, implementing it, of interruptability, and sponsoring the code of disabled publication.
But we can't also be pictures: to make the services of the beach, in time, you have to do them improving the interface of the tents, making them easier, all these things are done in parallel, but without the tubes, you can't do the chest.
(Audience) Yes!
After a few months, in the midst of 2017 we wrote the piano "Trienna" by the Administration Transformation, we did together with the agile of other people who helped us, what does a thing exist?
Two are written in a clear, technological way, but also in the process.
For the first time, it was assessed and sponsorized by the government, the trienal piano, put on the githab, the technical technology, the technology of those who understand it, and it's appreciated to the technical rules, and it's probably three pages of the piano, and it's a certain point of making the pieces in Italy, in Italy, in the public, the software, which can't be uncomfortable.
I had to improve it.
We dedicate ourselves to this moment, particularly, and this is always a part of the piano, to the agitating platforms, which are the digital platforms, they are those things that embrace all the activities of the public administration, and the more there will be.
Digital payment is one: electronic cards, electronic letter, the identity of digitalizing a mobile platform.
The greatest project we've followed is called the national and resilient population.
To put this, banalizing technologically all the data of you, citizens, that at this moment are at 8,000 different levels, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, in the only data, when I'm transferred to a common to the other, I have to say all those things I've already had to know.
Two weeks ago, we made a series Akaton, all of this, which we're talking about sustainability and scalpability, in the sight of old and sponsors, all the documentaries, and all the coders, but not always more, the applications of the Italian publication: now there will be a fifth of technological points, as well as it's from the Italian, the future and today we dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that normally don't limit themselves to do hydraulic, they also enter the boat.
But it's true that the paintings are complicated, sorry, I insist, this can be, for example, one of those things that would be: we're dreaming a little, because of work we'll really do so much, but it should be this vision.
A few weeks ago, the storm.
It has completed 150 years, they've written an uncertainty, the world that expects us and asked many people.
Talking about what you think can happen, I was asked to talk about simplification of the lives of every day of the citizens, I took the opportunity to write an article I want to mention.
Some fish?
It's a desire or dream, maybe we do it, we want a country where politicians who try to understand the digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rule and not the exception.
In other words, a country where they read recognize and promote the right to innovate, to embrace it.
A country where technological skills are also inside the State and public companies, a country where there are more public and private companies guided by 30 years than for 70 years.
Imagine, in the end, a country where working for public administration is an owner, where better brains make people work in the centers of public research, that are green and their centers of excellence and innovation that take development to the country, so that if it's a dream.
And that the components to do all this, digital, technological processes, are really many and maybe too many, but if it's not a dream about which pointing is hard, they can do things.
But before conclude, this is my mother who belonged to the people who told me what I'm doing, and here came somewhere in this theater between the other.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the digital Tinet, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
And if you want information about us, our site is our social, thank you.
And did you know the possibility to make a desire?
One only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't go as you'd like.
(Laughter) On this, I was sure that I would have taken all of them, or maybe winning the muscles, sometimes, during my life, I asked myself this question, "Well, here there's a little more freedom, and the answer was to fight, to try to understand how to change the things that didn't work in my life, when I became a psychologist?"
But I also put this research to other people, and I realized that they, like me, used three strategies mainly.
The strategy, today, more broadcast, is to wake up, we know many people who fall in the bottom of the window, these strategies are used in a small dose, they could also take some benefits, but as most of the cases happen, were the only three-carves to play in front of a crisis, not only to keep their problem.
I remember a girl, who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything else, who was addressed by when the last work of the government that hadn't helped her, felt like a true ability, and now that the mind had completely colonized her daily life, but lamented for all of us, helped her.
But, well, you can lament yourself at the roof, or in your mind, you can lament yourself hardly something around you, you will change, you won't do anything else, or something that might be more careful about what you say.
Another very objective strategy, when things are not like you, is that of lamenting, presents that someone is at the study of a B piano to save the skin, in the mouth to the magnifying glass.
(Laughter) At the base of this mentality, there's a growing cultural factor, based on which we learned that if something doesn't work well, it's enough to change it, can we manipulate our loved ones, what surrounds us, doesn't like us?
But from that aesthetic circle.
(Laughter) You feel a little further, but why never be in the suffering, take two pillars and we solve it easy?
His wife breaks, divorce.
I have fresh, we all agree how many risks on the palm: your child doesn't listen to you, less.
(Laughter) It's too big to not register it, send it to the psychologist, we're here for this, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice for this profession, to make the world around you get involved in perfection with your demands.
But the context inside which this energy strategy, in a very important way, are the relationships of coppy.
I remember one, a copy, during the collapse of which I didn't do anything else than listening to what, according to one, the other would have to change to solve the resources of their future.
So he said, "Yes."
It's true that you, to agree, but not even to prepare yourself in Chinese, which is also a classicone, and she, "No, if you don't look for me, you don't realize all the things I do for you, and she always begins with the same word stretched.
Anyway.
Because we have to show all the equation line of the other, we have to make them see all the problems that should be cured to reproduce our happiness that has kidnapped us.
But the truth is that if this thing we often say it in good ugly, believing us deeply, we can change something old, instead of choosing the noise at the base of the relationship, we will wait for others to change them, if the strategy that privileges, when things don't go like you.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, is to make us feel like a tool to take the head and put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, there's the fear of facing the conflict that would emerge, that we should show our needs, and then what do we face them for the common good?
Audience: Yes.
But in this way, we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity, and we live in the merce we need others.
I remember a young man in the young man, a young man in the youth, a son of separated parents, who, at the end of the first childhood, had learned to distress with great diplomacy between the tips of mom and dad, often spinning from the limits, learned important things, for example.
To listen to accept, to think about the motivations between them, even distant from each other, but on the other hand, they never learned to say no to the things they didn't go well, they didn't learn to tell their desires and ambitions, they were always supposed to tell you how many.
If the strategy that privileges, when things don't go like you, is to suffer your needs, first or then your body will start to talk to you, and instead of contenting all of you, I'll end up failing them.
(Laughter) To wake up, to impose your needs or to suffocate them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say, with the means of cause, because I myself, in the middle, has abused them, I tell them what has happened to me.
One day, the first part of the hospital I collaborated sent me to call and said to me, "If you like to continue the collapse with us, you have to accept a transfer here for her, there's no more place, and I'll tell me a long place to make a job that wasn't even a big deal with everything I had studied until then.
(Laughter) I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, trying to make them change the idea, adopting, but sending that other, and even less because I'd never had to accept a commitment that was unbearable for me.
I understood that...
But having different results would have had to do different things.
For the first time, of course, on my legs, at that moment, I realized that the secret, to change others.
It's changing yourself, if it were changed me.
The others would also be able to follow, modify, change.
If it was a super brilliant, competent, complete psychologist, the first one wouldn't send me via, but if I wasn't that person, the thing wouldn't have taken me much.
But the answer didn't go to the other's fault, but I had to introduce myself to the profound of my responsibilities.
But why things?
They don't change.
But we are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do is in the direction of choosing ourselves.
"Let's choose you as a cause of things that don't go as you want."
You choose yourself as a cause of things that don't go as you want.
This is our bias.
But if I never find the work of the crisis, you're putting the only arts to your disposal.
Now we'll find ourselves alone and in the hands, facing something too much bigger: I want to say, you'll always learn a new language, if reading books, to acquire new skills, to consolidate those who already have, you can work on you to become unique.
(Laughter) Because life is who does it.
Who doesn't do it, suffer it?
(Laughter) If inside the copy, things don't go well, you think it's the other to do the first step.
And maybe your own contributions, every day, this simple question.
What can I do today differently to make your best day, then things change, but they don't change, but they change because if you are you who have changed before going to the research of their lacks?
Now, it's the research of its needs, and then the workers to be able to satisfy them, and in this way that you create a mental space inside which you can take care of each other instead of making the war, if you are one of those people.
It's clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose the sense of meaning the things you do.
If you leave yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand which actions you put in the field to preserve them, then the game becomes something inside which you can become a better person.
When I was writing to the university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to understand them that, with my matter, there were practical tools, sometimes even fast to bring great value inside their lives.
But friends, I found myself with a couple of problems, stereotypes, prejudices, psychologist is the doctor of the debts, but I had to talk to a friend, but I went to the park, but what should I do?
I had to lament myself, or possible that I didn't tell you how much good psychology would have had to abandon my dream, no, I had to learn to speak a language, which was the one that didn't happen, as more close to the act, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to listen to their needs, instead of mine.
It's the turn of...
A little time, following this direction, I got results for me unimaginable.
And when I finished the collapse with my first and its transfer, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I don't know what to do.
I thought about it, and in the end I decided, I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as he understood him.
I'm transferred here.
(Laughter) I went home to the computer, and I registered a video that I carried on YouTube, in my YouTube channel, became a point of reference in Italy for what psychology looks at in video, thanks to this thing, every day, thousands of people are approaching in Italy, for what I watched in psychology, from the stereotypes I first I mentioned.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm in 79: I share psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best schools, in Italy, leaves my review, and what has collected me more about everything.
Because, obviously, they saw that my attempt to innovate the profession in a way to communicate it had something sense, and in Lombardia I was read to the president's vice-Colce: dreams.
They don't really become, because, fortunately, or because you've had that.
The theory that must have is the one that keeps moving forward, who doesn't know how it is built and needs to distrugle you, because the culprit should do it.
So, if there's something I've learned from all this inner journey.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but also the most urgent.
Audience: Yes.
It must come to our internal.
Ten minutes ago I asked you a question: if we had the chance to express a desire, one only to change a aspect of your life, that we hadn't talked about the work of the physical perspective of the current contact, what would you change?
Well, in fact, I'd like to leave you with a gift, at least to prove, it's a small question that was personally very useful, and that is based on the logic that, to get to produce big changes, comes to focus on many small actions.
But what's the smallest thing?
And more simple.
What could you do until now, at the end of the afternoon, to return home after this beautiful newspaper, and that will allow you to take the first step?
To put your life in the direction?
That you auspicize.
You can think, what is the smallest and simplest thing you can do to put your life in the direction you live in.
You see, you have your keys of the pride, you have to send you, or take part in the pull, do you see, but where do you put your bags?
Fairy, markets are the problems.
Obviously, today I call it.
Or your ugly, what's time to change?
Of course, when my mother comes, do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to talk for eight minutes.
And me, this?
I want to take this time by myself, here.
I had a dream.
To create a integration band, diversity and diversity, percussions are so fast, so immediate, they take the distances and unite the battles.
Audience: Yes.
Are we part of it?
We're lost in seven.
(Laughter) If you were young, I see them, I see the Laura, the Paola, Daniele, I saw them grow, our proveers were the mark of, the mark was the day of the test, where this stadium was in the music school of Andreoli.
But above all the first applause, we decided to make the first satisfaction, the first encounters, the first satisfaction, for the youths, for us, for everything we were doing: we decided to make the first musical brands and travel.
Unfortunately, a night of the 20th of 2012, the world was crossed, in the true sense of the word.
All the cases were completely unbearable or crowned: a strong earthquake hidden, covered our earths, and from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of the thousands.
For all the inequalities, we were called this.
As I said, the houses were no longer agible.
Many crossed: our proof room, our place where there were all the marks and it was completely district.
And the tools were inside.
What did we do: me, Sara, Marco, Fed, Matteo, we all looked for?
In the bottles, and the roads.
We were able, fortunately, we found them all.
We're all finished inside a tender, in a tender, in the thirsty of the end of the millimeter, inside that tender, there are magnificent things.
We've seen fear sounding stronger.
We looked at ourselves in the eyes, with the Earth that was shaking, to look for a smile, a look.
The Earth was shaking.
Isn't it there?
We built the first tools.
The scary cests became the houses of the band, the tubes that became...
The tools built and suited with ping pong racks: we were constantly working, always, there was an incredible energy, even if we were at a terrible moment.
But the inside was born in our first protocol.
We decided to put it on a real sponsor.
However, the group's components were increasing, the friends spent the word of 20 that we were, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We are part of the construction of the first protocol: the white.
Because it's the white man, because there were the smallest loops, the smallest loops and the white genius, at that moment, we all moved together as a loopy white.
Then, immediately after, we did the year later, we did the high school, the swarm.
We became all marine, because we really wanted to navigate and also move for a moment of our Earth.
To breathe for a moment, then we made it crack, this marine monster, immediately afterwards.
50 speakers, this flying boat, and to finish this year, the sea of the Moon, the sea of the Moon.
We wanted to close a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
Thank you.
There were so many things inside this tenderness, and none of us would never have thought that a tender could change life, but we did it.
Audience: Yes.
But I want to tell you one thing.
And my last one is finishing.
But everything we've done in these seven years really seems to me a favola.
Audience: Yes.
150 concerts spinning in Italy.
The first magician's stage?
The concert in the TV program at home.
It's the lack of radio, and we really did so many.
And also to me, screaming for the voices.
And it's exactly the scenery of life, the factory of the sweat, but also of freshness, that is so much possibility to the future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality, now I have to come from the flows, they expect me that there's still so much?
And to build, thanks to everyone.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Firradini, and in fact I was born as a lawyer, until the moment I asked myself what happened in the last 250 years.
It's what we've studied in these 250 years, which summarizes the industrial revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the Internet Revolution, and the content we're all living in, we try to understand, then, what happened in these three, because we have, and yet, a country ready to incorporate this innovation in the past, and a motorcycle.
The phone, we still live it today, we know that it's the use of transporting our voice, but it's also what has allowed us, in the industrial revolution, we're not only in the motorcycle that has allowed us to avoid, in fact, before, to continue to see our lyrics, and to continue with the scent that has developed the automobilist industry, and everything that has always known.
Today, it's the Renaissance, there, a time in 1873 was built by Santa Radagonda, where there's the first continental electric power, in that year, on December 30 was lit the scale.
A part of our history is born from there, but in these 50 years of the Internet's revolution has always been more significant, always more structural, but it begins to be born something, to compose something that has never been in the history before, and they have simply fasted the calculator, and they decided to open these laws.
And these challenges, called ARPA, the network, became able to bring information to give you an idea, in 1981 they were only 300 the computer connected to the Internet, to give you an idea, in 1995 they were 25 million.
Not many.
When the mechanical strength has started to include the artificial intelligence of computers, and the mobility that has been introduced by the industrial revolution, today, is in the order of the decades of billion, because we are not talking about computers that we use, but of all these intelligent systems that connect to the network to pick up data or to work data.
That I'm essentially an industrial process that tells us that what is a new progressively destroyed what is old because we've lived now, that we're living now, the one that is called in the Internet, we've had the time we started to live in the time that we've lived now, that we're living now, try to accompany you.
When, little by little, the Italy hasn't done the Italian, it established that the 27th of the middle of the middle is corresponded to the payment and public dependents.
At this moment, even if we don't realize it, we are introducing something extraordinary: first the wealth of a family, more than a single one, was in its ability to produce good and services in the power of production of one, the denial.
But there's a second aspect, which is the fridge, and it's not only the object that frees us from the audience to go and do the spirit every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to preserve, in a massive way, a structured in a healthy way, in fact, the intelligence of the daily life.
What they've done, typically, when they look at the story of understanding the passages of a century to another, 2001 and 2001, but when we were doing something, we didn't innovate the biggest economical crisis, which, in fact, was certified in 200,000 years, but we were not only able to do something that hasn't come to live in order to be very fragile.
So the commerce, or the digital system of digital systems, are ten percentual points under the media, we try to look at the state of health and competence based on what allows us to enjoy, we are almost close to a connection and speed for 50 percent.
In fact, it's born a very profound change, and this is the first asset that we have said in the production of services: we're growing fast, there are small ones, there are two factors that, in fact, have a very profound change that will be able to make a lot of attention, and this is the first assessment in a very profound decent speed, in a very profound environment that will lead us to the country's, which is very competitive production system, which is very important.
Venezuela, circumstances, and then they repeat, I believe that this is the greatest one to recover, to include this heritage inside a knowledge system that allows us to carry it and enjoy it, and to make the tourism not only to visit three centers, but to visit all our country.
The topic I spoke about in a certain sense is the opposite act of the word that unites all this.
But in Italy, if someone asked you, and if I asked you, in the last 20 years, I've prepared for the majority of you to answer our encounter, and with the only 24 hours of disguise, I'd like to start in the last century, because I'll talk not about sharing, which is the inequality.
This is the curve of the development of inequality in Italy, from the beginning of the second Republic, and in Italy, from the beginning of the second year, especially in the '80s and '90s, but in the last 20 years, we have a trend of decreasing inequality.
Well, maybe it's wrong, and if the feeling of an increase of inequalities that many of us, the same, weren't wrong with the feeling, the data didn't suppose our feeling as we think, but we could also ask another question: How can we read these data?
Maybe we have to think about the concept of inequality on what we understand for inequality, maybe the concept of inequality requires a century, some rethink.
