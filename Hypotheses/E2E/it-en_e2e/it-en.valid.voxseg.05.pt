In 2016, I was given a prize.
From the "Nassuna Forum Fortice Inghilderni."
I was supported by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, from the name a little particular.
KA: They are born in HIV.
The motivation of this award was my availability in the confrontation of the students and my ability to create data environments.
It's less formal, more relaxing, let's imagine that this is a big university class.
The usually entered class.
The first ten minutes, when the students enter.
Thank you very much.
I put my computer to explain and put a classic music.
And he thought, "This is the LE.
Well, the first step to create data environments, less forming the most resilient.
And try to maintain the attention of the students.
Unfortunately, it's not always easy.
During my lessons, I use a method used until the old age.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, the storytelling is a method based on the use of narratives.
To transmit knowledge to students.
It's exactly with this moment that I'd like to start my lesson.
Let's explain, let's describe a top.
But on the mouth of everyone, normal.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that children tell, I'd like to start my story.
There was once.
Second World War.
In 1942.
It's a nest.
Blece and Park.
One.
A north residence of London.
And there was a young and 30 years old.
Alan Turing.
Let's move forward the team College of Cambridge.
And they get a research doctor in logic, at the Prince University, in America.
At that time, the Tedes used a machine.
Special.
It's enigma.
It was a machine to write.
The operator digitalized details, but old that stuck on a paper.
In fact, those letters are stuck other letters, according to them.
Or a code imposed mechanically under the hand.
The texts used this mechanism.
To communicate with them.
Anyone would interceive this paper in front of you without any sense.
It was a belief.
Alan Turing.
It was one of the main figures in Blue Park.
Keep calm.
And I built them a machine.
What can you see?
Let's go back, able to decipher.
These tests were written by the Tedesque.
For this invention, we think that war is.
But it's finished with two years of anticipation.
It's saving many human quickly.
In the adventure, continuously, after the war, to do its logical research.
And it's considered the father of computer science.
The father of artificial intelligence.
With your Turing machine.
And he formalizes the concept of computer, even before the computer was created in practice.
In 1950.
It's a article about the "Mind magazine."
"Computing Machines and Intelligence."
But where does the test propose?
The question behind the testing is a very precise one.
They can think machines.
Here's the Artificial Intelligence.
Probably many of you have seen the movie of Emiteation game, the game of limitation, I want to explain to you.
Do we ask ourselves if there's a person here?
It's digital to the computer.
What asks and asks questions, and on the other hand, a machine is broken.
Well, it's an operator.
In an alternative way, the machine M and the O.
But they provide the answers to the person standing.
It's said that the machine takes over the Turing test.
If the person is not able to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the operator.
And this is limiting a game.
But the machine must have special characteristics to overcome the attitude.
But it must interpret natural language.
But the question who comes from the person?
It must represent knowledge to form the answers.
And it must think in an automatic way to form these answers.
And it must learn automatically.
But there are different approaches.
So to study artificial intelligence.
One of these is the cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this approach.
There are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to capture thinking at the moment they are in.
Or we try to modify the thinking at a psychological level.
That's why artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive neural sciences and psychology.
According to this approach, the assunction that if we can really have a female representation of human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of the laws of rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man.
All the men are mortal.
Socrates are dead.
This is a deductive argument.
Do you give two premises to laugh?
It's due to a real conclusion: from here the logic of all kinds.
The second is the approach of thinking laws.
But do you try to build educational arguments?
And to see them in a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational agents.
A rational agent, an entity.
(Laughter) It must act.
It must be adapted to the context.
But it must be part of the goals.
And knowing how to bring them to end?
And it must act in a rational way.
So TestD Turing is linked to intelligent people.
But reformulating the Turing phrase can think.
We can say, "Can we create a machine?"
An artificial agent.
And I'm able to think.
To demand intelligence and rationality.
So artificial intelligence is the purpose of creating entity.
Artificial, intelligent.
Your phone is an entity.
Among the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence, as a psychological construct.
Once we have more knowledge.
What about this?
Yes, I try to build entity.
Artificial intelligence is supported by humans.
It's a guy.
But let's see today.
It's the machines.
They can think.
And I said, "I'll go."
Let's explain to you to describe the state of art, artificial intelligence.
And I'd like to use.
There were five classes.
To classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We have subtle agents.
For humans.
Sovereignity.
We have human beings, and finally we have optimal agents.
Let's take this with some example.
Other animals are the agents that act better than all men.
I don't know how to form.
For example, people who isolate the cube of Rubik play a four-year-old strength in the best way, play a sad, think that a few years ago a young man has rescued.
It's given the start of the Rubik cube, it's solved in 4.73 seconds.
But a few months ago, they created an agent, a robot that was able to solve the zero.63 as well.
We have the sovereign agents.
Why do they act better than all people?
For example, in the game of the rocks.
In the game of the scary.
A few years ago, the championship ...
The Russian of Skakis, Gasparp, was killed by an artificial agent.
We have people on human beings.
The ones that exist almost like all people, for example, in the Power Texan game.
To answer the question of the kitchen.
We have people for humanity.
What do they act?
Almost like all people.
For example.
In cognitive activities, like the crowned words.
Or the classification of image?
And finally, we have subtle people who manage the worst of all people.
Exemples are the case of objects.
The recognition of caligraphy, the vocal recognition, the translation of a language to the other.
But if there's something that artificial agents, today, are not able to do, for example, is disambiguation.
And we're talking about the result.
AD: How?
Well, the mum!
Or are we talking?
From the body Apple.
It's something that agents are not able to do, it's the region in the ideal world in uncertainty situations.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence, for which we think we are far from overcoming the test.
Let's see now in the future.
They will be able to think.
A few years ago.
In America, a thing was introduced.
From the technological name: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest experts in artificial intelligence in the world.
Imagine the time line.
Imagine a line.
What indicates human intelligence ascending?
Now imagine a red line that indicates the machine intelligence with an exponential approach.
This is a blind moment.
What is the challenge?
I predicted in the wall's leg.
That's why.
The computer complexity, for example, measured with the number of transistors inside a chip.
She was two years old and in four years old.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to...
It's made of this computer complexity to simulate the human brain.
I don't see anything.
Well, in 2020, we would have access to 1,000 dolls to this computer capacity.
In 2025, secondary, Cruce Valley.
To never be able to rest in a precise way our brain.
And finally, in 2029.
And the machines will spend the test, they will overcome the test.
And then?
In 2045, and the indication of the moment it will have the technological singularity.
In which machines will follow the intelligence of the machines will follow an exponential environment that will radically change.
What is human intelligence?
In his article.
It's published on the Mind magazine.
Turing not only proposed his test.
But it also proposes new objections against the same term.
What are these objections?
With us, objections against artificial intelligence.
Any year ago?
I was a student at the University of Varese.
I followed a path of epistemology, deontology and ethics of computer science, came from it.
"Professor Gaitano, Aur√©lio Lanzerone."
Unfortunately, a few years ago.
The UN of I.A.
The competition we had to move was to propose a decade of obedience.
But against the test of Turing, with artificial intelligence.
And I was the only thing I wanted to propose.
A decade formulated, with mathematical communication.
Take a look at human stupidity.
But I want to describe it in simple terminals.
Let's suppose to take the intelligence of all people, to put the seed.
It's a symbol of summers to the minister of equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
So we got it.
It was an equality of intelligence.
But in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But what if it's true that we were?
To transfer our intelligence inside a hand.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we left the machine become more intelligent than us.
So to conclude my story.
I'm going to take you away.
The initial question.
They can think the machines.
I'd like to leave you.
With an open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Good afternoon.
Who of you today has taken pictures?
Thank you.
This gives me more or less the measure of not having worked.
Completely in the bathroom.
And it's up to everyone, I'm called Irenealis, in other words, a journalist who takes care of photographies.
Well, I'm the creative director of a study that takes care of photography and I'm a person who does it.
There's a lot of pictures with their phone, which doesn't absolutely make me a photographer.
I've spent the last three years.
This is me, immersed among my maps.
To take care of a liquid matter.
So, the MOPA is the photographer, which is the product and broadcast through the cell phone, its limits, its contradictions, its potentialities, its impact on the market, its projectual and authority use.
But what sense can I have, try to understand such a contemporary contemporary that changes while we're here to discuss, this is only one of the questions I've asked myself in these three years and that interests me to share with you this afternoon, but there are many others.
In which way does photography change the processes through which we communicate?
We can consider the photographer a new language, in order to influence the aesthetics of the vision that forms of compassion, the technical consciousness there is.
Well, in the production of a scenario, from a professional photographer, there's still the difference regarding the simple gesture.
The first one is a smartphone.
And how does photography change the forms and the structure of professional photography?
To find answers to these questions, I tried to open a confrontation.
With pictures, rescuers, criticisms, theories that deserve the photographer had the way to develop experiences and reflections.
I've been a professional photographer, instead, for the first 10 years.
I asked them to share with me the challenge of this new means, to embrace the challenge of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the successes, of their shared experiences, of sharing images through the cell phone.
To find answers, I looked around me.
And I arrived in New York.
At the DSC of the photo editor of New York Times Magazing, in Cathy Ryan, in Berlino.
Well, in the IM sede, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock.
Parigi.
So, in the "Parifoto" room, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world, to enter those places in which photography ...
It's distributed, it's sold, it's put in context, and understand how the photographer changes these engratulations.
To find answers, I tried to look beyond the surface of the great common places of the contemporary.
For example, the selfie.
The challenge to get involved, simply, to a global narcissistic delirium, is to get into connection like some psychologists have sustained with the discourse of body dismorphism.
And to remember, even correlated, like some sociologists have written with the occupational bass of the generation of the millennials.
Or you can't be seen as a health and affirmation of yourself, as an identical stadium, as a reappropriation of life.
It's just an image, as it's joyfully reivindicated by visual artists, feminists, like "Keitard Ben."
"Look at Sholager."
The phyto-bindagesthetic that has signed and still segregates our mobile vision.
This is my dog, Zazi, a victim designed by my photographic experiments.
It's simply the result of a world's world's world's worldwide epidemic, or, instead, as the social associated with New York, can't be read to the most complex factors of nature.
Social, historical, even economical.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of answers, it's the territory of interpretations, and of this phenomenon I've tried to give an interpretation in a book.
It's called "revolution."
All of us, for a story of the photographer, because in front of the excessing image we were exposed, it seemed to me to try to draw a hand.
So, if not to find the route, at least to understand what we are.
And how are we?
The story of the photographer is short, but in a few years I've invented millions and millions of people.
A new code that exceeds every linguistic barrier, used daily to communicate and test ourselves, to feed a constant flow of images that make individuals from an angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, or a collective world, if you want, that has impressive numbers: every two minutes, today, we scat more images of how many humanicans have been taken in the interaction of the year century.
More than 350 million of these images are carried every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
Well, the production and the diffusion of images, of activities that, until a few years ago, looked at a research collection of professionals, became a instinct of our private sphere in the public dimension.
But in which we define ourselves through the images we produce.
Or better, we exist because we produce images.
And if the photographer is a new language.
So it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that is still strongly drawn by that process of liquidity.
Of the certainties, so brilliantly individual, from the Fozigmunt Bauman philosopher.
It's like a typical.
From a modernity, the structures, the work, the family, the copy, are always easier, and here actors are unstable points in a universe in movement, sponsorships in front of the media of the most natural expressions.
A liquid vision that is composed of the components.
It's simply based on the instant gratification of our sharing need.
But in a world where each one, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone, which is the professional photographer, and what a difference happens?
For photos.
Western and conscious photographs.
On the one hand, the facility of using the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing professionals the universal language.
By taking action with the process of democratization of photography.
I started with Lera Kodak and arrived until the iPhone.
On the other hand.
The use of cell phone as a reward tool offered to professional photographers.
The new possibilities in approach to stories, to the contents, to the subjects.
Still, on one hand, the disturbance.
Everyone of us has a dialogue channel, with a potentially global audience, has moved the professional photographer of their own grandfather.
As a producer of images.
It put me in crisis the social function, the economic position.
We just need to think of the rule that the photographer and social network had.
In the first Arab Spring.
To prove that it's a powerful tool to orient.
The public opinion is a capture of machines and information, difficultly controlled by the regimes, this is an image of dogs, a show that the Folfang of SN has dedicated to the rule of the photographer Mobile in the first Arabic.
But on the other hand.
Let's think that the possibility of direct interaction through the web, through Instagram, between the photographer and the audience, has liberated it from the impossible to reach the destinations of their message, if it hasn't through traditional channels, like Siki of information, megaz, daily, galleries, of access and limited resources, and has allowed them directly in the use.
By collecting visual content in real time, a particularly interesting photographer offered the magazine "Time," in 2012, with the cover, via Instagram in real time through the Tey Copper's mechanism, their own images, delineating a new model of New Smaking and visualism, the reality in journalism.
This is the book machine that has had origin after this experiment.
And if it's true that in the "disna," "sciat," we photograph.
Impulsively, and we rarely come to look at our images, producing a number of photos of great-personance to the one we are able to remember, and I also see that in this same era there are new paths of preservation of the iconographic memory.
Like, for example, 7 female photos, a Instagram photographer based on a American photographer, Rayce, Kur Nissen, and dedicated to the preservation of the universal heritage of the family photography to the times of photography photographer scavenged by the fights, every photographer, through an Open Kolla, all the users.
It's the roof of a global comer we were in, in which to read and control the evolution of photography and society in Novecento.
Or, they are born.
Nine paths of curatory selection, like 1415 mobile photographers, created by two Italian photographers, Giulio Napolitan and George Posulic, through a job of scavenging in the highest levels of professionals and narrative photographers around a topic.
But then are the photographs that in the last years have operated this tool with a great authority awareness?
I'm photographer like Michael Cristo Fer Brown.
Let's take it.
Now, a life that has used and use the smartphone of conflicts, showing how the agility and the description of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of deepness.
Photography as a cup that belongs to a simple smartphone has explored new paths for Newsmaking, creating a well-being platform to put in touch the American soldiers in the south of Afghanistan with their families and create a motor of information from the front of the first hand.
Bread Mengin, who used it for sport photography, exclusive territory of photographers with hyper-performant appearances, and made a vehicle of intimate narration in the middle of the basketball.
Research Cirnandt, who enjoyed discretion and manner for photography street, creating a very personalistic aesthetics.
I'll tell you that it made me a little bit of denouncement, going back to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, and creating a community that attacks the parts around the Sun.
MTIX that uses it daily to build its family album, inerting a reflection on how Instagram changes the facts of our privacy, and the way we build and preserve our visual memory.
Peter of Campo, which is through the African Hever.
I dedicated to the story of a daily and normal Africa, from there to the media stereotypes of Western matrix on the crisis and the fame, has shown how the photographer, far from limiting themselves to discuss the photovoltaic stereotypes.
As they know Luigi, who has interpreted the Omer's history with the cell phone, telling in the AI series of ones of the oldest heritage of the West's history with the new vision tool.
It's like an Ilor Linde stadium that photographed the manifestants in Piazza, who are the protests of Midan, with a bronic old man.
And contemporary has registered, with its cell phone, the moment when the lab of the abroad is buried.
And the image is born, translating such a photographic experience in bilk, tragic and digital, far away past.
It's contemporary.
Well, what do these photographs know how to do?
Trying to go to the outskirts of action or looking for personalized tags on the event.
More than recording.
Creating images that are never straightened to reality, but that are born from a profound interaction between photographer and content between photographer and subject.
Contaminating creatively the code of the storytelling.
Projecting in a media owner, thinking about their own content to be broadcast on different platforms and reaching different audience.
To do the net.
It's using innovative connections.
Putting on the authority exercise for their point of view on the world and the quality of deepness, because anyway is the tool that represents prejudice.
Only if the conceptuality of photography is smiled by a lonely, articulated in a powerful way.
Is it possible?
It's about getting hurt.
And from the visible rumor of the bottom that offers us the eyes.
All of this, I believe.
It's still the difference between photography.
Mera.
The real resource.
Hello.
The limit, reproduction, its self-reference and sharing, and a photograph that, in reality, can still be a cultural metaphor.
Thank you.
And do you feel it?
And do you feel it?
What we believe is silence.
And actually?
It's 50 ERC of electrical race.
Fifty-thirds that were immediately entered.
Or in our lives.
We wake up from the illusion that silence exists.
(Audience) Yes, but...
Don't exist.
So also in this room, those protests, these seeds.
And put a 50-year-old frequency.
Your imagination, right?
I went home after a job day.
It's really stressful.
Keep your partner with your partner, except you're going to read in the bubble of your bedera.
And you think it's just one.
But no.
There's always the law.
This frequency of 50R.
Because I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible, in our cases, in our lives, but it's more or less this sound.
It's a negative story.
The silence doesn't exist.
But well.
The goal.
But we are never alone.
There's always this beautiful race.
A 50-year-old frequency.
Very good.
Paranoid.
If we look at it.
Like a drawing.
The frequency of 50 seconds is nothing like that.
I'm a wave.
A beautiful richer spectrum.
With which you can do music, and then I asked myself.
Let's have it like this.
Music.
I'm a composer of sound colonies.
I was complicated life deciding to make music alone and exclusively through rumor.
My parents?
They started when I was a kid.
I don't know.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
But no.
The revelation of my life.
And the loneliness?
From those days, in the weight of the void of that house, I started to make music with all ci√≤ that surrounds you.
I said.
Each income complement was no longer.
A classic complement of network.
Very, moving.
First of you.
This is my musical tool.
It's pretty.
I don't think about the bikes.
I say, at some point.
I tried to become...
It's a normal person, I try to say.
I tried because I started studying.
A strong piano.
Then I liked Woody Allen, right?
So I started to stop Clarinetto.
The problem was that I really liked Arenzo Arvor, who wrote a magiciously ambiguous song, guessing it like the first years of study in Genova.
I didn't even know Clarinetto.
That's how, to not go...
I make the illusions of my classmates.
"Yes."
But why did I abandon all this, why did I study and escape from that notation so rigid?
Because there's more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more sponsor in a rumor.
And I like to paragonate it to the problems of life.
All of us have attacked them.
A rumor, a failure.
Something that made us think.
I'm sure that this rumor made us grow much more.
From a smile.
So, what is my mission?
After that, when I'm a child, it's to transform a failure, a rumor in music, and to harmonize everything I'm around.
Let's talk about it.
I say.
Let's make a beautiful turning point, Gino Paoli.
And everything would be concluded, but no, I was complicated in this way life.
What is it?
So, sound.
But above all!
What is the study?
So, the study is one of the most difficult senses to understand, but also the most immediate, the most powerful.
But to transmit an emotion.
Our internal eye, the protein of the oceans, our team, reaches the maximum functionality.
But around the fifth week of gestation.
The next week of gesture means that we start to listen.
Before talking, we started to listen even before seeing.
And this is not a case.
Because the fact must be ready.
I know that the sponsor in life, once born, must be ready to the northern text, it shouldn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So not in case, if the mother, during pregnancy, listened.
British rock, there's no way to stupidize if the child once was born.
"Yes."
It will be listening, for example, Shakespeare.
AD: Yes.
Put the hands.
Well, I'll show you, and it's a richness that I personally make you attention to the musical choice.
What else?
What is it?
What are they?
In other words, that's it.
Everything we're surrounded is the intangible that becomes emotional.
What in our lives is completely different.
But you don't see, you don't touch.
For me, the colony is time for every day, the rhythm in our partner, the mother who screams us, because the mother screams us, still, always.
All of this is the sound colony of our days.
That's it.
Of course, the visual is much easier.
I don't know.
The visual is when we enter the system's hair, we say.
It's smaller than how I imagined them.
There's more small than what, there's more small than the man of Milan.
The smaller than San Pietro.
When you're younger, maybe?
This thing, as when a person sees me in the video, or on the stage, and then I tell you about people, tells me.
Imagine, I was higher.
And, of course, because it's lower, it would be really impossible.
So ...
Going from this presentation.
And what about it?
It's what allows us to imagine.
But I'm black.
Have you said it?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's go!
To imagine our lives, I would like to genuine your ability to observe.
Let's go.
In vacation.
We're in the sea, not in case.
And I started.
We take pictures of our feet, in the wise, then it's Lettino, then in another perspective, then it's photo from the bottom, they don't do it, but we also do those, then it's the opening time, so we call a drone to make a photo of the driver, then it's 360 and the attention, it's coming to the time of 100.
There's the doll, no, not eating the doll, because I have to take a lot of photos: well, I have a soccer blog, a kilometer, a kilometer, a kilometer, I don't know, I've lost the story, but it's multimensorial, multi-sensorial, many soccers.
But nobody eats the doll.
I photographed it.
And we look at it.
Let's do many videos.
But we never stop listening.
And we never stop.
To listen.
But not even a person we know.
And I teach you a trick: when do you get it with someone?
The best moment to know the person is to stay in silence that silence that, on the other hand, doesn't exist.
Bai do it?
"Yes."
To listen.
To close and listen.
Like in this moment.
So, today I'd like to bring you with me.
I went around the world, I ended up evolving it.
Your perception of listening.
And I'd like to start by telling you...
And the dream of my life.
The dream of my life is born.
From alcohol?
One of me.
For the first time, the listening of myself.
But it was 2013, I wanted to run away from the History, a series of failures, problems and others.
Because then they turned into harmony, but I think I'm going to look for a very far place in Italy.
So, I decided to choose.
A city on the Atlantic.
It didn't exist there.
Isn't it still?
It's one of the largest cities, culturally.
It's really far from me, Shanghai.
I decided...
I participated in a competition, I came to an artistic residence and started the most beautiful years of my life, for the simple fact that for the first time I was listening to myself.
So, I didn't have money, I had so much fear.
I had an idea, but I was the only one to believe us, and it was the one that would have listened to the sounds of the whole world, of all the cities of the world, creating for each sound, a sound colony of every city, calling this project "Sound of Offsite."
And everything is really part of the city's disguise.
Cities are a great musical tool, to wake up this musical tool.
You can enter the last of the cities.
And I'd like to bring you ...
At this moment, Shanghai, where?
For 48 hours, I'm not registered the sounds of the city.
And I created a sound colony.
But why?
In this moment?
I want to sound.
Shangah.
Different!
I'm alive!
Okay?
Little by little.
I'm disappointed.
No, no.
I'm going to live.
They are still focused on the visual.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, let's say.
All included in the neighbourhood.
I'm sure you've photographed in every way.
And you're wondering more than once.
In smoke, the animal falls.
What are they doing?
But the bridge of Brooklyn can sound.
The bridge of Brookly is an exceptional that is located, completely in law.
And do you want money?
Couldn't it really affect me?
It's a collection and it's a good thing.
Thank you very much.
KA: Well, no.
Beautiful, but it's not beautiful because it's on the other side of the world.
But it's not magical because it's on the other hand.
It's magical because under our eyes every day.
And maybe many of you know a pair of places.
KP: In this picture.
The rule of deaf people is ...
How many hours?
Without sleeping, going around a city, losing yourself in the same city, well, I knew Genova.
I knew Genova because there were many times, there were absolutely captured many times, but I've never heard it so profound, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that between my favorite cities.
Scattered the applause, I took it.
[A.DE.]
I want to record the first sounds.
And the first sounds were given to these children, in this tube.
But from Ferro, an old man, they gave me this audio camp.
And I'll make you feel, before the Greek camp, and then that.
That's it.
Little.
And I like a puzzle.
Are you ready?
I'm normal, I'm never sure.
I said, "No, no, no.
She's beautiful, beautiful, and she's replaced me with this.
What do you think?
The Genova is Maur Zenzy.
(Laughter) It wasn't a battle, this is a serious thing.
To give the world.
And I wrote them.
That you see constantly in the beach of Ferrari.
And it's not just a writing, for me it's a great musical tool, and it helped me to support the bit of this colony.
And it's more or less like that.
The last sound, after I really want to sound like Genova, is that of...
All of them.
The boats of the port.
We are used to look at the top, but the sound is a perception that is opposed to the view, and so I created this microphone.
I immersed him for 48 hours.
In Genova's door, I found a sound of a track that gave me a particular frequency that became the melody, and when it became the melody, it's because putting it in the loop is transformed into what the lava is.
The important voice of the colony.
It's true.
Hello, now.
I wanted to make you feel a genius.
That's how I came to this point.
Here's Genova.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
This is the sound of our passions, in my and your own.
And for how many people will tell you that I'm rumorous, stuck, out of time, I really want to listen to them, and I'll always bring you to listen.
How is it said Guybek in Italian?
But, generally, you use restitution, it's not perfect, but the idea of the idea: to generate the idea of restitution linked to monetary restitution.
It's the benefit.
A lot of times, instead, the restitution is linked to reproduce what you did, what you learned.
And spending on the part of those who say, nothing works.
But then, in Italy, nothing works in this country, we try it, so the next 18 minutes I shared some point of this story.
Going from the end of the '90s, precisely, this is my son's army.
It's a reward, next to you, thank you.
In the same year, my monkey organized the funds to pay the material.
From the asylum.
And it was an activity.
But very heavy, made with many parents, some of them said, "No, why should we help, we must think about the common state?"
But most of them were extraordinary efforts.
To help the asylum to help the community.
It's collected a million 200,000 allies, because I don't remember, I'm 600 euros away.
And it was one of the individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later, we take the United States, this is now.
And it's similar: the same similar school for a close school, this is the biggest child.
And we have a completely different reality, that is, what was extraordinary for us, we realize that it's a totally extraordinary reality.
In other words, the thing of the game Beck of the restitution is very normal.
So the extraordinary effort of an Italian genital is ordinary for all that society.
Not that the American society is perfect.
Therefore.
I said this, the concept of restitution: I had fortune, I reproduce, I helped the school, I helped the university.
It helped the museum, the the the theater, there are all the communities, financially, of volunteer restrictions, not that there is no volunteer, but there is a phenomenon and a positive circle, and then there are also the mechanisms, there are the processes.
But it works, it's based on this.
I'm ten years old.
Some of you may know it, this is the launch of the web.
She has the support of the famous Obama Ker.
It's a title that says: "Desistemy is from now on."
Trump is trying us a lot.
But actively, it's called "System is one of the moment."
Obama has launched the famous bank, and there was an incredible technological debate.
Technological advance has been 600 million dollar, so not worried about these things that didn't happen only in Italy.
They build a site that doesn't work for many million contacts, and this is the standard answer they got.
But in short, you believe you don't finish for a few days, but then someone stopped criticizing, and it's enough to do it.
Going from criticizing, which is easy and normal to try to do and help, which is difficult, extraordinary.
For us, it's not a common thing.
This is Time Magazine's coverage.
But the experts of technology that were sent by Google and other companies have offered us.
And I agree with the Bianca house, I wouldn't have architecture, it's put in the session, it's stayed in a few weeks, in a decade of the costs.
For us, probably, many would have criticized, but Google, surely, has their own interests for this.
Audience: Yes.
And the extraordinary effort, and not the ordinary, I've seen that I've finished in the TAMEGS and it's very interesting.
But I want to explain what was spinning, I've spinning from people, more still.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this validity, this bag, and they decided to reproduce the experiences that had filled their lives.
In this case?
But they look at the ability to manage big technological systems, complex, unbearable processes.
Repetible.
And make them, sometimes, unbearable and unbearable.
It's to create a replicable system that is the USA, this effort was born.
A system replicates what we hope to do with us.
But I want to talk about the word model.
Because one also implies the models, the ones of our lives that inspired us and taught us.
Those who have taught you perseverance, the desire to never move, to continue to insist.
It's energy, empathy.
So these models are part of this bag that we need to use, we want to reproduce.
For me, obviously, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also the factor of Italy.
Almost 20 years old from the History.
But the idea of helping was also because I'm Italian.
Audience: Yes.
But I wanted to do it.
(English) Do you know what you want to do?
To do or not do it?
AC: There's no attempt, maybe the Italian river is to do or not do it, there's only to criticize.
A few years later, we're five to the San Francisco Mateorence, and we've come to the Silicon Valley to make the necessary transformation in general.
Something has discarded us a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of processes, for the digital transformation of the public administration.
I ask myself, because it doesn't come to help us in Italy for a couple of years, I think it's reflected in the regret of not thinking, between a few years I think I've tried and I haven't managed, or I think I don't even tried it.
The choice was made, and so it's been the Rome for two years.
A congress.
CB: Ah, Amazon.
But those who have to do it, Mallia, Amazon, Probono, Maiday, something will give you underwater, these are only many phrases, I have to say that we've also received so much support, so at this moment we're focusing on this part, but in a positive part there was.
But I was mentally preparing for skepticism and bureaucracy, people ask me, "But do you expect these little bubbles, and yes, I didn't expect?"
But scientificism doesn't often have cinism that characterizes you a certain mentality.
But I'll never do it, of course, because you don't have the rights, I've heard a lot of this kind.
In this country, in fact, the sense of common good lacks a lot.
And to do things because you think of helping, to improve a situation not only because it's not interested.
And here's it: for the days of you, this is a commission.
For the most elderly you recognize it, as I'm in the Middle Ages.
I say this because the beautiful title, my movies, after the beginning of extraordinary commissioners, is simply because it's their rule that allowed me to be able to take people out of the public administration.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is.
As the systems from inside don't transform, we want to try to transform them with people out there, where the fact that they don't know the public administration.
It's a asset, and it's not a variability, it's a advantage and not a disadvantage.
So, financially, we created a small team, I wanted a small team to read 25 people, a world.
But it's not big, but it's also too small: technological experts around 80% are expected to do legal judges.
It's the governative of communication.
Here you can see the post I had done when, by myself, I started this adventure, I said, because we don't write what I think will happen.
But in this way, we want to attract talents, talents that you live in Italy, or that you want to come back.
It's also temporary, it has a very well-being compensation to what you see, as I'll convince you.
So I put myself in the idea, but how do I convince someone to do the same thing I'm doing?
On the other hand, maybe some of you recognize it, that white photograph of the worm of the beautiful, that in the '47s all the United States have put the children of the phone, in all the United States, in this massive sport.
I've visited the investment of infrastructure.
We created the vision.
That the operative system of the country is a series of fundamental components that can build simpler services, effective for citizens, public administration and companies, through innovative digital products.
Sorry.
Very beautiful, the implementation, it's blood and blood.
I've continued in my place: soccer field in Salita, the American soccer, I'm wrong.
And I continued, we'll also find many rules complicated, sometimes incomprehensible, it's a easy prediction.
We must learn to manage with intelligence and bureaucracy, many will say, don't understand how public administration works.
But they've already tried us in many, they've failed, in Italy it doesn't work like that.
And I continue?
We'll get many criticisms: some comments will be useful, others will be cinemas and prejudices.
In other words, the criticisms of the first type will make people who really want to offer their contribution and they've found them a lot.
The second type of color they want to defend the state of the school is that they always see the bugs in the middle of the World.
Or that, simplerly, they were drawn to the helpless.
And this is a big problem.
To teach things that don't work.
Remember this image: first, men and women on the cover of Time Magazin.
That's it.
So, despite looking for the most possible people to do with the eye, I received about three,000 questions.
That certainly, at least a hundred decently qualified, we've used digital tours for the Colloqu, an app called Jazz, we have it in the middle of the government.
It's done a mathematical test, a third of colors, in technological part.
The team has reached the Chinese mass of Cirp, so there are seven people in the genius, now we are a little more living, and it has immediately started to operate.
In fact, we take care of Draulica.
These are the tubes of the administration public, some of them to do a lot about connecting, because the big problem is that the systems, the applications, anything that should be interconnected is "assylos" in not connecting.
And I'm not only talking about machine-machine, I'm also talking about people who don't want to explore their own data, their own software, their own applications.
So it's introduced to the thing, to write, to explain it.
And in years to implement it, of interruptability.
It's sponsoring the code of public administration.
The scores show us the software, of course, and make a lot of projects activities.
CR: So, so much hydraulic activity?
We can't.
The colors.
To make the services of the beach, in time, you have to make them better, to make them better, to make them easier.
All these things are done in parallel, but without the tubes you can't do the chest.
After a few months, in the midst of 2017 we wrote the piano "Trienna" to the Administration publication, we did it together with the agile of other people who helped us, what is it particularly the trendal transformation for the public transformation in my internship?
In other words, there's something that exists.
Due?
This is written in a clear, technological way.
But also a process.
For the first time, it was assessed and sponsorized by the government, Palo Gentiloni has affected the decrease of the present that is minister, the digital staff is a priority of the government, the Triannal piano.
It requires a team game to simplify public administration, the city of the citizen, particularity of the piano.
Well, one day to the year, because the planes can't be static, especially in technology.
And it's appreciated to administration.
But what is this, this is the only way to do the pieces in Italy, in the public administration?
It's regulating the technical rules and you read exactly three pages of view and connections to other norms in other rules, and at some point the technological rules are quite uncomfortable.
But unfortunately, we can't abolish these things, but we can do other things in parallel, so the trendal piano.
It's put on the Internet, the technology of you understand it.
It's put on the form where we can talk to the administrators, make us give feedback, the documentary on the rhythm of Ox, in a way that the administrators themselves, the technologies to publish software and the software can't exist.
And to improve it.
But we dedicate ourselves to this moment, particularly, and this is always a part of the piano, to the agitating platforms, which are the digital platforms, they are those things that enhance all the activities of the public administration, the more there will be.
A digital payment is one: digital payment is one: electronic letter, electronic letter, which is a habitable platform.
Identity to digitalize a habitant platform.
And the greatest project that we've followed is called national and resilient population.
Let's put this.
Using technologically all the data of you, citizens, who are at this moment, are 8,000 different sides, which are the 8,000 Italian communities.
The only data.
Yes, they are synchronous.
But where data is talked about them, they are all synchronized, and they talk to the rest of apps of the administration, when I transfer to a common to the other.
I must, in the beginning of what I've been managing, manually, then I have to go to the school, to the motorization, to all those places, I have to say, all those things that I've already had to know.
Well, we're solving it to technological solution, then we'll do so much about the process.
In two weeks, a week ago, we made a hackathon.
Seriously.
Where 800 software educators have worked on that brilliant application, they were used in 96 interventions.
Bagfixing, so, putting problems on software, a improvement of documentary and even new projects.
It was made in 25 Italian cities.
Well, I also know that it's not Italian, but there are many Italians who are helping us from the technological point of view, out of the History.
But what about all this?
It influences - we're talking about sustainability and replicability.
It's in the sight of glasses to sponsors of Italy, like T, where they are exposed.
All the documentary, in all the codes, but always more, apps.
In the Italian publication, now there will be a fifth of what would be left, maybe even less.
The future is today, we dream a little.
I was also working.
On other projects that normally don't limit to make hydraulic, they also enter the boat.
But it serves that the paintings are complete, sorry, I insist, this can be, for example, and it's one of those things I'd like to have.
Although we'll leave the alsa aviation, we're digital citizenship, it has the phone.
The smartphone has the digital identity, has data the electronic identity card, it has a stone.
Is it already functional?
And all of this, the goal is to make it easier, to familyize the interaction between citizens and the public administration.
With the simple interaction.
But we're dreaming a little, because of work we'll really do so much, but it should be this vision.
A few weeks ago, the storm.
And more than 150 years have written an uncertainty in the world.
They expect us to ask many people to talk about what they think can happen.
I was asked to talk about simplification of the lives of every day of the citizens.
I've taken the opportunity to write an article that I want to mention to you.
Some fish.
It's a desire or dream, maybe we do it, we want a country where politicians who try to understand the digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rule and not the exception.
A country where they read recognize and promote the right to innovate, to embrace it.
A country where technological skills are also inside the state and public companies.
A country where there are more public companies and private, guided by 30 years than 70 years.
Imagine, in the end, a country where working for public administration is a north, where better brains make money to work in public research centers, which are green and precisely the centers of excellence and innovation.
What brings development to the country?
That's why it's a dream.
And that the components to do all this, digital, technological processes, are really many and maybe too many.
But if it's not a dream about which points are difficult, they can do things.
First to conclude.
This is my mom who belonged to the people who told me, "Who did you do it?"
And here it's due to some parts in this theater, among the other.
But at this point, it's more calm, and I couldn't explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the digital Tinder, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do.
Let's see something.
Do you want information about us?
That's our place.
Did you know the possibility to make a wish?
One only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't go as you want.
What does it change?
What would change?
Please raise your hand if you would change your job, your genius, your own collaborators.
You're afraid, you're looking at you, it's for that, huh?
(Laughter) Because what's the title?
So raise your hand those who would change their own body, maybe lose some kilos.
Or maybe win them, muscles?
AC: Ah, well, here there's a little more, there's more freedom.
Now, raise your hand those who would change countless, better understand each other.
I was sure I would have traveled it all.
Or maybe you're the ones who would change?
But more times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
But let's not understand if you'll change the part.
And the answer varied, because the elementary ones would have a more united family.
But my parents didn't separate.
But in the media it would have wanted to be more beautiful.
To get closer to the youths.
In Liceo, I wanted to feel the most complicated teachers, they seemed to me all the hostiles, and I was reflected in music, here the great void to make in the room.
I went to the university, I wanted to work, but I met the difficulty of access to the job market.
So, all my life was part of my life, I started fighting and trying to understand how to change the things that didn't go well from what others thought about me to the great economical hands, from interpersonal relationships.
It has my characteristics, acquired the end of the birth.
And when did they become a psychologist?
However, I also looked at my research to other people.
And I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
But these strategies, if used in small doses, could also bring some benefits.
As most cases happen, they were the only three maps to play in front of a crisis.
Not only did they solve a good nulla, but they ended up maintaining their problems in life.
Today, strategy is more broadcast.
Is it?
(Laughter) The mind.
And we lament it a little bit of everything.
In other words, there's crisis, there's no work that's traffic, that's cold, that I'd have done in a different way.
We lament it because there's no justice.
I know many people who fall in the bottle of the window.
And the problem is that if it's mental space, this paralyzes you.
A kind of notice, and it's aligned to the mouth of today.
I remember a girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything else than when I started talking to when I stopped going home.
It started lamenting the ex-dancing.
She left her, then from the girl with whom she had translated her.
So the fact that I didn't have work, the last work of the government that hadn't helped it, felt a value, a capacity, and now that the mind had completely colonized all its daily life.
In other words, unfortunately.
For all of us, it's a bit the great attempt, because with a small effort you can get a great result.
To review the rule of the victim.
Who's listened, comfortable?
It helped me.
But beat well.
And you can lament yourself at night or day, alone or with friends.
Do you have a voice or your mind?
You can lament yourself of something that has already happened, or something that may happen maybe a tomorrow.
You can lament yourself at the roof, or as much more often happens, you can lament yourself in the right.
Because we all have many reasons to be able to mentally.
But the truth is that for how much you will make you difficultly remember something around you.
It will change, elderly, you won't do anything more attention to what is invested.
If the strategy that for the villages, when things don't go as you would like, is to lament you.
To assume that someone is at the study of a B piano to save the legs.
PK: In vocal.
Another very chosen strategy.
When things are stretched, it's the one to impose our need.
At the base of this mentality, there's a growing cultural factor, based on which we learned that if something doesn't work well, it's enough to change it, we can manipulate our pleasure, what surrounds us.
Don't you like the shadow?
But what aesthetic rule?
You feel a little further, but why never be in the suffering?
We took two pillars and we decided to do it.
Your red wife, divorce.
At fresh, we all agree how many risks to the palm.
"My son, don't listen to you, Menalo."
It's too big to manage it, to send it to the psychologist, we're here for this, on the other hand.
So, my vocation, the choice for this, this profession, to make the world around you fit the perfection with your demands.
But the environment inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way.
So, the relationships of the body.
I remember one, a copy.
For the colors of which I didn't do anything else than listening to what, according to one, the other would have to change to solve.
The lucks of their future.
Hey.
Well, but of course you're to agree, but not even to prepare yourself in Chinese.
Because then it's a classic.
And she, "No."
But if you don't try to be for that.
And he doesn't, you know you don't realize all the things I do for you.
And she, "No, if you didn't listen to me, otherwise you'd do good things."
To come here.
And that's how I saw the infinite, a logoring iron.
That always begins with the same word: stretch.
Because we have to show them all the water line of the other, we have to make them see.
All the problems that should be cured to reproduce our happiness that has kidnapped us.
But the truth is that if this thing is often said in good ugly, believing us deeply.
But we can hardly change something, elderly.
Instead of choosing the node at the base of the relationship, we end up irrigidating them to heal them.
Or if the strategy that privileges, when things don't go as you want, is to impose your need and wait for others to modify themselves as a consequence?
And think about a couple of times, because I'll have a life...
It full of resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy.
Well, when things are in a way that doesn't like us, it's true.
To make sure there's no way, like a building, take the head, put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, there's the fear of facing the conflict that would emerge, that we should show our needs.
So what do we do, do we suffer them for the common good?
But in this way we don't take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity.
And we live in the market.
We need them.
I remember a young boy, a young boy, a son of separated parents, who, at the end of the first childhood, had learned to distress with great diplomacy between the children of mom and dad.
I hope I hope that when you were openly drawn in the face of one, you would have lost the love of the side.
In this limited situation.
I learned important things.
For example, I learned.
To listen.
To accept, to think about motivations among them, even distant from one from the other, but on the other hand, I've never learned to say no.
They didn't learn the things they didn't go well.
Or to say no to the relationships they were going to look for, there was any relationship condition, and elderly, it was one of those who had to always be able to measure, but in this way they had to end their needs, their wishes and ambitions, they were always underwent to face the conflict, and they needed to tell you how much.
Because it's the strategy that privileges, when things don't go as they want.
Is it to suffer your needs?
First, your body will start to talk to you, and instead of telling all of you, I'll end up failing.
It's about lamenting.
To make your own needs or to suffocate them.
But there are three limiting strategies: I can say, with the means of cause, because I myself, throughout my life, have abused.
I'll tell you what happened to me.
One day, the first hospital I was collaborating, sent me to love.
And she said to me.
OK, here, for her, there's no more bridge.
If we like to continue the collaboration with us, we must accept a transfer.
And I tell myself a far away place, lost, detested by the most.
But above all, I would have to go there to make a job that wasn't even a big deal with everything I had studied until then.
I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, to try to make them change the idea, to adopt, but to send that one.
And even less because I had never had to accept a commitment that for me was unbearable.
And then, what?
And to get different results, I had to do different things.
For the first time, of course, on my legs, at that moment.
I understood that the secret, to change the others.
It's changing itself.
And if it was changed me?
The others would also be able to follow, change.
If it was a super brilliant, complete, unique psychologist, the first one wouldn't send me to travel.
It's also the same phase.
The thing wouldn't be stupid.
Let's see, maybe I've been going through me before I'd still call him.
But I wasn't that person yet.
But the answer didn't go to the other's fault, but I had to introduce myself in the profound of my own.
Responsability.
Why things?
Don't change.
We are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do is in the direction of choosing ourselves.
You choose as a cause of things that are not like you want.
You choose yourself as a cause of things that are not like you.
This is our own.
But if I never find the work of the crisis, you're putting the only weapons to your disposal.
Now we'll find ourselves alone, in the hands, to face something too much bigger, I want to say, "It's the crisis's fault, what do you want to do?"
But if you're part of you, and you think you're perfect, that maybe there's a change mark, then you open doors in front of you, because it defines your responsibility, you do it, you can always decide to learn a new language, if you read books, to acquire new skills, to consolidate those that already have, you can work on TED to become unique.
Because life is those who do it.
Who doesn't do it?
I got it up.
It's inside the comet.
But things don't go well, you think it's the other to do the first step.
And you're sending them a message of inequality, and you're far away.
If you're part of you, maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question.
What can I do today differently to make your best day?
And then things change, but they don't change, but they change because you're you who are changing.
First, he went to the research of his lacks.
But now she's looking for her needs.
And then we try to operate.
To be able to satisfy them.
It's in this way that it creates a mental space inside which we can take care of each other, instead of doing it.
I don't know, one of those people.
Those who are with everyone, who always have to say yes, one of those people I call, ask me in the end, in relation to them.
It's clear that you're not only losing time, but you also lose the sense of meaning, the things you do, if you start yourself, to understand your needs, try to understand which actions you put in the field to preserve them.
So the game becomes something inside which you can become the pattern of the tail.
Being starting to work on me, considering myself a cause of the things they didn't go as I wanted, instead of their simple effect.
I also started to have a better person.
But when I was writing to the university, I had a dream.
The dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to make them understand that, with my matter, there were practical tools, sometimes even fast to bring great value inside their lives.
But friends, I found myself.
I'll talk to you about it.
The problems.
Stereotypes, prejudices, psychologist is the doctor of the matters, the psychologist is the doctor of the debts, but I had to talk to a friend, but I went to the park, but what would I have to do?
I said, "No."
I had to lament myself, or possible that I didn't tell you how beautiful psychology I had to try to change their mental priority, I had to drop my dream.
I said, "No, I had to."
In other words, learning to speak a language, which was the one who didn't happen, as the one next to the object, had to learn the dynamics.
I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way.
I had to learn to listen to their needs instead of imposing mine.
It's about...
Little time.
According to this direction?
I've got results for me.
You can imagine.
When I finished the collapse with my primary and its transfer, I didn't sleep for three days and three names.
I don't know what to do.
I thought about it, and finally I decided.
But I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as he understood him.
I'm transferred here.
I went home, I killed the computer, and I registered a video I carried on YouTube.
In which I spoke about psychology, here for the chronologist I'm talking about to undertake the anxiety because maybe you think it's.
From the turn of a little time, my YouTube channel has become a reference point in Italy for what psychologists look at in video thanks to this thing every day thousands of people are approaching the psychology by discussing some of the stereotypes I mentioned before.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm in 79: I share psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best schools, in Italy, leaves my review, and what has collected me more than everything.
It was the recognition that the colleagues, at first a little strange, wanted to leave.
Because, obviously, they saw that my attempt to innovate the profession in a way to communicate it had something sense, and in Lombardia I was read to the president's vice-president.
What dreams?
But they don't become reality, why?
For example, fortunately, or why did it have been here?
It's the theory you have to have and that.
It's the one that keeps moving forward.
Those who don't know how they build and need to build.
Because the culprit should do it.
It's also so much to discuss your identity, your points of belonging to your certainties, your rooms of always.
That's it.
If there's something I learned from all this inner journey.
It's that the most important transition.
Maybe the most delicate, but also the most urgent.
But it must come to our internal.
Ten minutes ago I asked you a question.
If I had the chance to express a desire, one only to modify a aspect of your life that doesn't happen.
What would change?
And we talked about work.
It's the physical story of the short story.
Well, I'd like to leave you with...
With a gift, at least try it.
This is a small question that was personally very useful.
And that's based on logic that, to get to produce big changes, we have to focus on many small actions.
What's the smallest thing?
It's simpler.
What could you do until now, until the end of the afternoon, to return home after this beautiful newspaper?
And that will allow you to take the first step.
To put your life in the direction?
I'm going to explain.
You can think, "What's the smallest, the simplest thing?"
What can you do?
And to put your life in the direction that environments.
What about it?
"You have your keys of the fridge, you have to eat."
Or, ugly, do you leave the pull?
But where do you put the bags?
Raise your hand.
Please, don't you like that?
Obviously, today I call it.
We suffer from them.
What's time to change?
(Video) My son is when my mother arrives.
Do you know something?
The TEDx?
Well, it gave me the chance to talk for eight minutes.
And that's it.
But I want to take this time by myself.
I had a dream.
To create a integration band.
Diversity and diversity.
And percussions are so fast.
That's how you can see.
They take the distances and unite the battles.
Are we leaving?
We are part of ourselves.
You're young, I see them, I see Laura, Paola.
But, as a result, I saw them grow.
Our proofs were the marketing.
The night was the day of the test.
Where was this company entered?
In the distance, in the Andreolic Music school.
We took the first bidons.
It was together, the first waves together.
Then we decided to become a good mark.
From there, we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical brands and travels: the first flaws, the first brands in the pieces.
And the first satisfaction, the first encounters?
The first satisfaction.
For the kids, for us, for everything we were doing.
But above all, the first applause.
Unfortunately...
One night of the 20th of 2012, the world fell down.
In the real sense of the word.
All the cases were completely unbearable or crowned: a strong earthquake shaped.
And from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of the thousands.
We were all called this.
As I said, the houses were...
Not more in Gibi.
Many crossed: our proof room, our place where ...
Where there were all the Martians, it was completely district.
And the tools were inside.
What did we do?
B.G: I, the Sahara, Marco, Fede, Matteo.
We looked for them.
Thank you all.
Narrator: Nevetteine d'Apolis.
And the aircraft?
We were able.
Luckily, we found them.
We're all finished inside a tender, in a tender, in the thirst of manifesto, in the end of the media.
In that tenderness?
There are magnificent things.
We've seen fear sounding stronger.
Because the flag of the fruit sounds stronger than the term.
He looked at us in the eyes.
What about the Earth that was shaking?
But to look for a smile.
A look.
And the Earth was shaking.
It's exactly there.
We built the first tools.
The scary cests.
They became houses in the bank.
The tubes that have become...
The tools built and suited with ping pong racks.
Changing them with big housewives, crossing.
We were constantly.
But in continuous work, always, there was an amazing energy.
Even if we were at a terrible moment.
The inside was born in our first protocol, we decided to put it on a real sponsor.
However, the group's components were increasing, the friends passed the word.
But from 20 to 20 we were, we became 25 to 30 to 40.
It was five years old.
We are part of the construction of the first protocol: the white.
Because it's the white man, because there were the smallest loops, the biggest loops and the white genius.
At that moment, everyone was moving together.
It's like a white man.
Then, immediately after.
And what did we do?
Last year, we did the high school, the curve.
We became all marine.
Because we really wanted to navigate.
But it's also to move for a moment of our Earth.
To breathe for a moment.
Then the year later we made a crack, this marine monster.
What happened immediately after?
50 speakers, this flying ship.
And to conclude, that of this year, the sea of the Moon.
The sea is from the Moon.
We wanted to stop a second.
On this Moon, it's looking at the sea.
There were so many things inside this tenderness, and none of us would never have thought that it's a tender.
But he could change his life.
But that's it.
But we did it.
But I want to tell you something.
The minutes are finishing.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems to me a fauna.
It's 150 concerts in turn for the adventure.
The first magician's stage?
GV: The concert in the TV program at home.
Is it the lack of material?
And we really did so much.
AD: And also me?
Let's get rid of it, because this is exactly me.
It's exactly the scenery of life.
The fatigue of the sweat, but also.
This is the freshness.
It's a lot of possibilities in the future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes the other?
Now I have to come back from the fruits, they expect me.
Is there still so much?
And to build.
Thank you all.
One, no!
Due.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Firadini, and in fact I was born as a lawyer, until the moment I asked myself what happened.
In the last 250 years.
No, no.
250 very important years that changed radically our history, and that we live currently.
It's about social innovation.
And my question is: What is this social innovation?
And above all, our Italy, which is often so biased, is a ready country to incorporate this digital innovation, and ready to be tested at the same time of innovation.
This is the digital metamorphosis, we all carry it.
To us, an object, I believe almost everyone.
That, in fact, incorporates an evolution that was extraordinary and has crossed these 250 years, it's the phone.
The phone is a technological solution that belongs to the industrial revolution.
It's an evolutionary computer, and the computer belongs to it.
And the revolution is the Internet, it's connected, and once again, this is an invention of the Internet revolution, of the Internet, of our history, and yet.
These three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new time, that we have, in some way, strictly battled arbitrally in the 2000s, that we are living today.
Let's try to understand then what happened in these 3 in these 250 years, that summarize.
The industrial revolution, the Internet revolution and the Internet villages, the Industrial Revolution, when we look at it, we probably remember it as a Ferrovia.
What did we study to me?
It was on the school book, in fact, it wasn't just a iron.
Well, we, at the industrial revolution, are enormously debated.
And it's enormous debates, for example, because we need the vapor motor.
And the vapor motorcycle isn't just a vapor motorcycle, but it's, for example, that has favored, and it has resulted much faster, the carbon stages, and the network is possible to a low cost.
And then the vapor motorcycle has entered the corners, it has entered the founders, and it has started to change the modality, but it doesn't make sense.
And we don't only have the motorcycle.
To vapor, do we need them?
The scope motorcycle.
The scope motorcycle, because, on the other hand, it's an Italian invention.
The motorcycle has scored.
But we must, for example, the automobilistic industry.
In fact, before the Christmas industry, because the motorcycle was a motorcycle that couldn't leave the farm, when they were able to understand.
It was a motorcycle in terms, when I couldn't understand how to get out of the scent, to make it even true, and it became with the scent that has developed.
The automobilistic industry is everything that has arrived.
But not only that.
In the industrial revolution, we are still debates, for example, for the phone, the phone is not only with the tool that has allowed us.
To avoid continuing to see our letters and that has speeded the migration of these letters from one part to the other of the world, always more broader than they knew.
But it's also what has allowed us and has taught us.
To deposit the caves?
It's under the sea.
And yes, because then it was the phone, we couldn't try it in the sea, and then what did we do?
We interrupted everything.
NJ: No.
You're moving forward, standing on the sea.
The first cavity, to give you a storal dimension, was taken from Italy between medicine and readable.
Not just two populations wake up of agreement, but the first cavity was there.
And we are around 1852.
But there's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know what it is, we use it, it brings our voice.
And in 1877900 subscribed to Rome.
It's only 1870 kg.
It's another intention and it's electric energy: the first electric center.
Western, in Europe.
It was built by Santa Radigonda, where there is it.
It's the Milan Rina, today he must be born.
There, a time, in 1873, was used the first electrical central.
In that year, on December 30th, the scarce was lit.
It's a part of our history, and it was born exactly from there.
But we move forward, we try to take a little further, and we get to 1950.
The school is already grown, and it's getting to know a certain agency, on the other hand, it was a century.
It's still in the course, but it has already lived important developments and also important emotions after cultural statistics.
But it begins to be born something, to compose something that has never been in the first story: they are the computer, which are calculators.
Three colors that, at the beginning of the '50s, could be in a stadium like this, and they had functions of neurocarcology.
They simply made the calculation faster.
But they went forward and evolving more significant, always more structured, always more intelligent.
And they became intelligent contributors.
They started to be the artificial intelligences we know.
But in these 50 years of the Internet revolution, what happened?
There were research institutions, and above all, there were scopes of all the defense.
Those who have brought to develop subtle reactions, but not underground because they take them on the ground.
But it will happen because they were not known.
At some point, we decided to open these laws.
And these challenges, called ARPA, ARPANET, the network.
They became and started to be the World of Web that we know.
In other words, a broadcast, or horizontal system, not hierarchical, extremely captivating, capable of bringing information, of gathering information, of generating information.
To give you an idea, in 1981 there were only 300 the computer connected to the Internet.
In 1995, there were 25 million.
It's not there.
Today, it's in the orders of thousands, because we're not talking about the computers we use, but of all these intelligent systems that connect to the network.
But to care about data, to pick up data, or to work for data.
When is the mechanical strength?
It was shared and replaced.
It was introduced by the industrial revolution.
It started to include the Artificial Intelligence of computers.
And mobility.
(Audience) Yes!
The Internet.
We had the time we started to live the time we've lived now, that we're living now.
The one that is called on the Internet, and this, according to a phenomenon of creation and destruction.
Because I'm essentially an industrial process that tells us.
That what is new progressively destroyed what is old because it needs space.
And we'll see better then how, but this is the story of the great numbers, of the great inventions.
But there's a story that is a little more human, that belongs to us a little more, on which I try to make a reflection.
I tried to accompany you.
It was 1863, when, little by little, the Italy hasn't made the Italians yet.
The Minister Minghetti put me in the Finances Mingetti.
But it establishes that the 27th of the Middle Ages is corresponded to the payment and public dependents.
And from 27 to the next months, what happens?
At this moment, even if we don't realize it, we're introducing mini strangers, something extraordinary.
But before the richer of a family, more than a singer, he was in his ability to produce good services that were necessary to its own sustainability.
But with the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky.
One of the stages, less risky from the challenge, started in some way from far away from the Earth.
And that's it.
It has transformed the economic power to produce goods and services in the power of production of one.
Well, the denial.
I'm going to take a second step.
And what is the safety?
For us women, obviously, it was a revolution that has enough to read.
But what was the fridge in fact?
It's that it's not only that object that frees us from the audience to go and do the spirit every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to preserve it.
In a massive way, a structured way in a healthy way, in quantities of food.
So, a D?
It gives us the possibility, once again.
To focus on something that is not.
Immediately, the use of everyday life.
And this is the man who begins.
To live to the end of November, these are us.
And in time, how did we say it?
I arrived at the computer and arrived on the Internet, and then there's a figure that has characterized these years, that is an element.
That we can define as the qualifier of these years: speed.
We, 250 years ago, were not fast as we are today.
We, today, do things very fast, move fast and speed.
The speed of the challenges, the speed of the movements, the speed of our movement, and also the speed of our thinking that is not said the quality of thinking.
But we are very far from him.
But until then something happened.
Typically, it's close when you look at the story, to understand the passengers from one century to the other, and sharing data that are not necessarily zero.
1900, 1900 in 2000.
When can we say that the 20th century is finished?
I believe, but this is really an orbitrary belief that there are two data that significantly segregate the passage from one time to another, 2001 and 2001.
He gave the waves, why?
First of all.
So the American economy started to slow down, and on the other hand, there were Torri Gemelli, and so something in balance started to change.
These equilibrium that seemed solid, we realized that they were very fragile.
But we went forward until there was something that has slowed all the time: the biggest economic crisis that the Western world, the oriental world together, had never met.
There's not only America to be real.
Almost closed.
There was also nothing.
But there were European states that were to fail.
The Greek is already the threshold of failure.
But they don't talk to us, but still there.
And something changed.
And he told me, "What has changed, the economic paradigm has changed?"
We couldn't.
But not to wait for the biggest economic crisis.
That, in fact, if it was verified in 2008 it was crazy not to think.
But how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension?
When can we do everything?
With many less people.
It was obvious that it would happen.
We were old and we didn't know it.
And to wait, look at these companies.
And what is this company?
But they are stable multinationalities, in their majority, but above all, they are all companies that are Dante after 2011.
What did these companies do, don't they innovate?
And by inventing something, they didn't innovate building something that wasn't there, but they started to do what we've always done, to buy and sell, to travel, to learn.
Learn.
The different way.
In a more efficient way.
In Italy, it's so often denied.
Let's try to look at the state of absolute and digital Italy, according to five factors: connectivity.
We are ten percentual points under the media, but, honestly, we are almost close to a fast connection for 50 percent.
So much, it's little.
Anyway, something, according to human skills and human resources, competences of curving it, of a different being between advanced and basic skills and basic skills on what allow us to flow.
The informatic systems of digital systems, those advances that allow us to develop.
It's a third future that we have to look at the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it.
A third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of the digital factor in productive processes.
So they start.
Or industrialization of products and services: the fifth or digitalization.
This is the system of public administration: we immediately want the field of some ambiguity and we keep the first two that are important.
In other words, a good news for everyone: all the five elements are increased, they are all the five elements that are in a growth, in a growth speed, completely in at the end of two years ago.
We are aligning European countries, and this doesn't work news.
But, on the other hand, with activity, we said it in ten points out.
But, specifically, it's enough to look at the newspapers and see who.
We are growing fast, there are new in exchange between new operators, new competitions, and a fabric is building.
It's very important, the use of symptoms, we're really seconds a little.
In fact, a very profound change is born to the European standards.
But there are two factors that we have to look at with great attention that will be key for our country's future.
And they are the skills and the inclusion of digital in brutal factors.
In this way, we have to pay a lot of attention.
For the characteristics of our country, we have two engines.
The first driver is what made the Italy in the '50, there are the small companies.
According to being, the small business, something not useful, not effective, not paragonable to the big multinational companies, in fact.
I'm probably the most effective entrepreneurial tool to interceive the speed of change: they're agile, they're fast, they're small.
They know how to do something extraordinary that "Made in Italy" has an excellence in the production of service in the production of products.
That it's pretty unique in their DNA, everyone wants it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, competences inside these realities, because these realities can become the multinationalities that we talk about Financial Times.
In other words, those multinationals that can help.
A whole segment.
The market, the extraordinary way, generating richerness for the whole tissue around you, and this is the first assault that we have, the first great motorcycle, the second cultural motorcycle that is the Italy her cultural heritage.
A heritage that nature, for her existential nature, thanks to God, is an analog heritage and will get an analog heritage: we can't digitalize the crop.
But is it possible?
That tourists visit only three cities, Venezuela, Rome, and then meet.
But the richer of these three cities don't do it.
No, the richness of our country.
And we're learning, maybe we've tried to start, but we're fast to recover.
To include this heritage?
In a knowledge system that allows us to carry it and enjoy it, to make it notice, and to bring tourism not only to visit three centers, but to visit all our country.
And I believe that this is the greatest urge we can.
To do is our Italy.
Thank you.
I'd talk about it in a certain sense, and the opposite action of the word.
What does it mean?
Well, all this.
Our encounter.
It's the opposite of the word "shot."
Because I'll talk not about sharing, but in a certain sense of the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'll talk about inequality, I'd like to start first.
Come on!
A question.
But if someone asked you.
To fight for it.
According to you, in the last 15, 20 years, we say, in the 21st century, inequalities in the world, the inequalities between the citizens of the world are increased or decreased.
But I believe most of you will answer.
Yes, I'm increased, if you were the journalists, maybe you'll get there.
The precious goal is increased in a exponential way.
That's me.
And I asked you, "But is it in Italy?"
But maybe the answer of many would be.
Keep calm.
I'm ...
I asked these questions in the last few years.
PK: And how?
(Laughter) The only 24th is the foundation of the video.
I've prepared it.
With my colleagues, a report.
In inequalities?
Let's start.
From when they are data, that is, financially, from 1960.
But for the biggest majority of the countries in the world.
The result is what we see.
But this is the curve.
This is the challenge of inequality, directly between the citizens of the world, as you can see, there was indeed an increase of inequalities, especially in the 80s, but from now on.
And from the end of the last century, at the end of the 90s.
The compessive inequality between the citizens in the world is crowned and precipitated.
Now we're at the storal mining, and in Italy.
GV: In Italy?
In other words, inequalities are quite complicated, even here we have an increase throughout the 80s, but in the last 20 years, practically.
From the beginning of the second republic.
AC: We have a trend of inequality of growth.
How can we read these data?
Well, a possible reading is to say, "We've traveled a collective bubble because we've been talking about years of inequality increase as it seems."
The data doesn't exist.
What are our feelings supported?
And there's really, surely, in this reading.
But we could also ask ourselves another question: What if the feeling of an increase of inequalities that many of us have the same?
Let's do it.
But it wasn't wrong with the feeling.
But maybe it's wrong?
So, the idea of inequality, about which?
PK: I don't say a joke.
AD: Perhaps.
We must reflect on the issue of inequality, on what we understand, for inequality, maybe the concept of inequality.
But it requires some rethink.
Do we find it?
Time was in suspicious this question.
And we move around a century.
And also, let's move to Cambridge in 1928.
A year before the great crisis of the 29th, Lickens.
It was Cambridge, a discourse pronounces.
Let's move forward.
AC: It has a student audience, a famous discourse, with the economic title for our grandchildren.
In that occasion, Keynes forms two professions.
KA: The first says.
It's a century the productivity.
So, an hour worked.
Is it?
AC: Otto times the one of today, that is from 1928.
And this trade, in fact, is made because if you went to take it.
There are the reconstructions of the stories of the economy.
And indeed, most of the advanced society, we have it.
A increase of productivity in the turn of 100 years, which is also DDP.
A 10, 12 times, in some case, 15 times.
This teacher is.
AD: It's true.
But from this professor Keynes, there was also a consequence, an idea, that is, humanity.
So little by little, that is, it's done to say a little to 100 years.
It would be found with a huge amount.
The free time that would have it.
"Yeah!
And to work less?
And he also said, to work everyone, and when he said less, he understood a week of 15 hours of work.
Or a horse?
From three hours of work a day.
And he saw a problem for this, because the question that was asked Keynes, but with all this free time we knew how to use it well or not.
AD: Well.
Apparently, this second thirsty hasn't been made.
Because we all see it, we don't all work.
And it doesn't seem exactly what we work three hours a day.
I don't know.
I'll show you that this teacher is divided in two parts, there's one that says we'll all work, it's certainly false.
But the first part we'll work much less, we'll work three hours a day.
But are we sure it's not?
It's made from anywhere, we're going to see what happened in Italy.
That's it.
Kurva or this trajectory represents.
But what is time fraction?
It's an Italian, medium.
(Laughter) It dedicates the work in the course of your life.
Your life, naturally, is potentially working, that is, for 15 years, then when?
(Laughter)
I'm able to compare a job.
And well, if we look at this trajectory.
Keynes's teacher was actually made, because we were at the beginning of 900, almost 40% of our lives's time.
To work, and now?
But we call it around 16%.
And the interesting thing is that this 16%.
That's it.
Two hours and a fourth a day, that is, the barrier of the three hours in Italy we already have it.
Naturally.
Well, if this happened, there are also ears and banals.
For example, the old age is enormously aligned.
Because we die a lot later, life expectancy is the one who has succeeded in something like 27 years.
It's from the beginning of the last century, from 900.
There's another very positive reason.
And other banals, if you want.
What about our children?
Luckily, they study, they study long, they also study until 25 and 30 years old, so the young girl got along.
But there's a more fundamental reason why.
CR: Our quote of time?
Dedicated to work, of course.
AD: It's it.
The crop of the occupation rate, that is, the number of people.
FD: What job!
This is the historical series of total occupation.
It's built for this occasion.
It's this dramatic series, because it makes you see.
Okay.
In the beginning of the century, in all monarchical era.
But before the Second World War, the occupation rate was even true.
I hope it's higher than 70%.
AC: Today.
We're very low, we're around 50% scarce.
Thank you.
KP: From 1968 and except one year.
The occupation rate has always been inferior to 50%.
But is it a step of occupation?
It's inferior to 50%.
What does it mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, who don't work.
The pure consumers that don't perceive any network.
There are more workers.
FD: But, in front of this?
That's it.
Storical.
AC: We can also have a reaction.
But it's enthusiastic and say.
But what is this?
AC: And the progress, beauty.
(Laughter) It's modernity.
Things went like this, because we can do it for them.
But then, do we see?
If in the country that the problem of modernity, that is in the United States, things have been in the same way, because if this interpretation is fair, it should have happened even in the United States.
And then we see the confrontation.
Let's go.
Italy.
And the United States.
This is the storal series of time.
It's dedicated to work in life, as you can see, and the United States only waves up to the 30s, then it's established, but it's a reading tendency to the increase while we crash.
But even more impressive, it's the storal series of the occupation rate, because here we see.
There's an increase, that small one you see below is the crisis of 29: we have a general tendency of the occupation rate in the United States.
But at the increase, in our case, we have it.
A situation.
Audience: Yes.
Riduation.
It's the occupation task.
But then, this one?
In Italy, it's a pathology.
Well, it's not normal.
Okay.
There are more people who consume without producing than the people who produce.
But is it not normal that the majority of the population?
I lived in a condition that I'll define.
"Dad."
"Dipendency parassitary," "dependence," because it depends on the network you are.
This, you can also be a family, the State.
But in parassitary, why do I consume?
I have the right to available without working.
I have a friend who does it.
But when did I find these results?
And we were in the chairs.
You, how?
Let's represent this situation with an image, a situation of parasitary dependence.
And you know what my soul is.
With the hypothesis, is that lights?
It lives on the sphere of the hypothesis, but it's called buffagon, some say buffaga, here it is.
If you want to have an idea of how it behaves.
The bubble or the bubble on the prototype, or on the other big mammals, and these fish also live on the broken rivers.
On the bubbles, well, we have this film.
It will treat us for a second, in which you can see.
[A.DE.]
What about these fish?
How do they live?
Speaking.
In the resources that the bubble provides, which are in sects.
The larvae zeke, all that.
Why Alberga?
It's on the bubble, it's not clear.
If the bubble is happy, that eye.
That mistake can mean that it's playing, that it's shaped by the lights, even if it's.
That's it.
It's not the one that happens in nature, but I'm not an ethologist, I do the sociologist, so the question I asked myself as a sociologist.
It's one.
But how can we define a situation like this?
A society in which there is a majority of pure consumers.
It's a minority of producers, how do we define a society in which?
There's this kind of productive consumption.
But there I said to myself, "But this is the society to sign?"
And society, gentlemen, like the feudal society, in which there's a ceiling.
"What?"
That has put in the condition of living without working.
Audience: Yes.
Naturally, it's not enough: you have to add a qualification.
Well, this is indeed a condition.
What could be defined?
Special society, ladies and gentlemen, mass society.
Audience: Yes!
Why? Why?
Because consumers are more producers.
So, in society, it's simple, classic: we have the gentleman and the serves of the globe that produce for him.
Well, in society.
And here the report is clear: it's a relationship of commanding and subtomission, in the ignorant society of Mars.
But things are a little more complicated: gentlemen, many became.
"Yes."
The relationship between signals and producers is much more complicated.
I believe you're a goodson, a great anthropologist.
Psychologist would have defined it a relationship of legacy, let's see why.
AC: Let's take the legs, why?
KA: The relationship?
The bubble with the hypothesis is parassitism, and this is a advantage signed in green.
But it's also dependency, because it depends on food.
What is it?
It's the backpack of the helicop.
The indigenous freezer.
Don't get up.
And also from the point of view of the producers, we have, again, a red fresh and a green light.
The hypothesis is autonomous, it doesn't need bubble.
So, but it's somehow in an obligation report, as we are in the face of the color we maintain.
Because we can't, we can't do it.
Not to nourish the fish they live.
And on their sphere.
So the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of legacy, but it's a situation.
That doesn't go well.
It's a situation.
In which?
A new problem of inequality, and now we get there.
This is the question I had asked about Keynes.
Today, maybe, the real inequality.
And the inequality of access to work.
The access to work is very asimeteric in our social system, but if inequality.
And access to work we can use the tools.
It's the analysis of inequality, that is to calculate a coefficient.
A concentration of genius, which is the tool with which.
And if we measure inequality, we can do it.
To apply to work: there are people.
They don't work, who have a means of work, who have two jobs.
And the position of the History, in this scale, of inequality, of access to work, is dramatic.
The position is in Italy, huh?
(Laughter) It's serious.
Very good.
In the graduation, together.
At Turkey?
In the country where inequality reaches the maximum, but simply because there's the exclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, probably.
Why would we have the palm of this?
It's the best situation, the one of the northwest.
KA: With the United States.
I stayed in the middle.
Do they miss us?
It's to become an Oxis country, normal, seven million places.
But how did we get to that?
This is the story.
For the inequality of access to work in Italy, it's always measured with some genius efficient.
Do you see something clamorous?
That inequality is the minimum, during the monarchical age, especially under the fascism.
And it's massive in the public age, especially under the second.
It's the one we live in.
There are 7 million doors left.
If we had seven million jobs in more.
Well, our families.
They would perceive it.
1,000 euro a month, in more, we would have 12,000 euros of round, in more.
In the year, and our state would have 150 billion euros to spend as much as they cost the health and the school put together, more or less in Italy.
I conclude.
There's a point.
Audience: No.
We have the scholarship to write.
The first title of the Constitution: "The Italy is a democratic Republic based on work."
But we are the only country.
Who has this in the first?
It's the small one of the Constitution, and we're the worst country together with Turkey.
That's it.
That's it.
But we change things.
We believe it.
The seven million posts of work they lack.
Or maybe it's better to cancel the article one of the Constitution.
Because, being so, things sound like a bug.
Thank you.
