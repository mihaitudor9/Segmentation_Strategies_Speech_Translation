In 2016, I was given a award: from the National Forum Forticing Learning, supported by the Ministry of the United States in Irlanda, from the name a little particular, they were born in Church.
KA: The motivation of this award was my availability in the confrontation of the students and my ability to create less formal, more resilient environments, let's imagine that this is a big university class.
In class, the first ten minutes, when the students enter and get there.
I put my computer to explain and put a classic music, I think this is the first step to create less forming data environments and try to maintain the attention of the students.
Unfortunately, it's not always easy.
(Laughter) During my lessons, I use a method used at the end of the old age.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, the storytelling is a method based on the use of narratives to transmit knowledge to students, and just with this method that I'd like to start by explaining you a topic about everyone's mouth.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that children tell, I'd like to start my story.
There was once.
Second World War.
1942, a nest.
Blockchain Park.
A ...
Resilience in northern London.
There was a young, 30 years old.
Alan Turing.
Let's see here in Cambridge's school.
And they get a research doctor in logic, at the Princeton University, in America.
In that time, the Tedes used a special machine.
Enigma.
It was a machine to write.
The operator digitalized details, but old that stuck on a paper.
The texts used this mechanism to communicate between them.
But anyone would interceive this paper in front of you without any sense.
It was shouting.
(Applause)
Alan Turing.
It was one of the main figures in Blue Park.
What about your team?
And I built them a car.
What can you see?
In other words, in order to decipher.
This test is written by the TEDx.
For this invention, we think that war is finished with two years of anticipation.
It's saving many human quickly.
Alan Turing continues, after the war, to do its logical research.
And it's considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
(Laughter)
With your Turing machine, he formalizes the computer thing, even before the computer was created in practice.
In 1950, an article published on the "Mind magazine."
"Computing machine learning."
Where does the testing propose?
The question behind the testing is a very precise.
They can think.
From here on, artificial intelligence began.
Probably many of you have seen the movie of Emitation Game, the game of limitation, I want to explain to you.
But do we suppose there's a person here?
FDigitality is the computer.
That asks questions and on the other hand, a machine M is an operator.
In an alternative way, the machine M and the speaker or form the answers to the person standing.
(Laughter) It's said that the machine takes over that Testituring if the person is not able to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the operator.
This is the limit of a game.
The machine must have special characteristics to overcome the testimonies.
You must interpret the natural language.
The question that comes from the person must represent knowledge to form the answers.
It must think in an automatic way to form these answers.
And it must learn automatically.
There are different approaches to study artificial intelligence.
One of these is the cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this process, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to capture thinking.
In the moment they are born.
Or we try to modify the thinking at a psychological level.
That's why artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive neural sciences and psychology.
According to this approach, the assunction that if we can really have a female representation of human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of the laws of rational thinking.
Probably many of you have heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man?
All the men are mortal.
Socrates are mortal.
This is a deductive argument.
Do you give two premises to get rid of?
It's dedicated to a real conclusion, from here the logic of the whole, according to the approach of the laws of the thought.
It's trying to build educational arguments and get them into a machine.
Another approach is the approach of rational agents.
A rational agent, an entity.
(Laughter) It must act.
It must be adapted to the context.
And it must be carried out objectives, and know how to bring them to end.
And it must act in a rational way.
So TestD Turing is linked to intelligent people, reformulating Turing's quote, a machine to think.
We can say, "Can we create a machine?"
An artificial agent.
I'm able to think.
To exhibit intelligence and rationality.
Thank you.
Artificial intelligence, so it's at the purpose of creating artificial entities, intelligent, your phone is an entity.
Among the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence as psychological construct.
Once we have more knowledge.
That's it.
What's the problem?
It's close to build artificial, intelligent identity and support of man, it's a cycle.
(Sigh) But let's see today?
If machines can think.
I'd like to explain to you to describe the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I'd like to use five classes to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
So we have subtle agents.
For human beings.
Sovereignity.
Superhuman.
Finally, we have optimal agents.
I want to explain to you with some examples: optimal agents are those who act better than all men and can't do better.
For example, people who solved in the Rubik cube, already with four in the best way, play a sad, think that a few years ago a young man decided to start the cube of Rubik, took it in 4.73 seconds.
Do we have sovereign agents?
Who act better than all people?
For example, it's a game of the rocks.
In the game of the scary.
A few years ago, the Russian Scakis camp was killed by an artificial agent.
We have people who suffer humans, those who manage almost like all people, for example, in the game of the textbook, to answer the question of the kitchen.
We have teeth for the mother.
Who act?
Almost like all people.
For example?
In cognitive activities, like the crowned words.
Or the classification of image?
And finally, we have subtle people who manage the worst of all people, for example, are the case of objects.
The recognition of caligraphy, the vocal recognition, the translation of a language to the other.
But if there's something that artificial agents, today, are not able to do, for example, is a disambiguation: we're talking about the result.
How?
The mum!
Or are we talking about the mark of the body Apple?
And one thing that people aren't able to do is the reasoning in the ideal world, in uncertainty situations: these today are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence for which we think we are far from overcoming the test, we see now in the future.
Audience: Yes.
They can think the machines.
A few years ago, in America, a thing was introduced by the name of technological singularity: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest experts in artificial intelligence in the world.
Imagine the time line.
Imagine a line.
That indicates the human intelligence ascending.
Now imagine a red line that indicates the machine intelligence with an exponential attitude: this is a blind moment.
Landing.
I've predicted in the Moore's law, for which computational compassion, for example, measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, radiated for two years and in four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to...
It's the use of this computer complexity to reduce human brain.
I don't need it.
In 2020 we would have access to 1,000 dolls to this computer capacity.
In 2025, according to the Kurzvale River, we will never be able to get rid of our brain in a precise way.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will pass the test, they will overcome the test.
And then, in 2045, and the indication of the moment it will have the technological singularity.
In which machines will follow the intelligence of the machines and will follow an exponential environment that will radically change human intelligence.
In his article.
It's published on the mind magazine.
Turing not only proposes its test, but it also proposes new objections against its same test, these objections are us, but also against artificial intelligence.
But a few years ago?
I was the only one that proposed a decade formulated, mathematical communication, and I was a student at the University of Varese, followed a path of ethology and ethics of computer science, given by the Gaithan professor Aur√©lio Lanzerone, one of the compounds we had to move against artificial intelligence.
It's the desire to describe in simple terminals, we suppose to take the intelligence of all people, to put the seed, the symbol of submissions to the minister side of the equations.
So we get an intelligence equality, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were us?
To transfer our intelligence inside a machine.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we left the machine become more intelligent than us.
So to conclude my story.
And by getting rid of the initial question, the machines can think.
Now let me leave you.
With an open question.
That's it.
But it really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
How many of you today have taken pictures?
Thank you.
OK, well, this gives me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in the bathroom, and it all saves me the creative director of a study that takes care of photography, and it's a person who has taken so many photos with their phone, which doesn't do absolutely me in a photographer, I've spent the last three years.
This is me, immersed among my maps, to take care of a liquid matter: the photography, which is the product and broadcast through the cell phone.
Her limits, her contradictions, her potentialities, her impact on the market, her projectual and self-esteem, but there are many others, in which way the photographer changes the processes through which we communicate.
We can consider the photographer a new language, in order to influence theesthetics of the vision that forms of communication, the technological consciousness there is in the production of a scenario, in part of a professional photographer, is still the difference than the simple gesture of a pulse on a smartphone.
And how does photography change the forms and the structure of professional photography to find answers to these questions?
With future editors, careers, critical and theorists, who have embraced the challenge of this new means, I asked them to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the successes, of their shared and images through the cell phone.
To find answers, I looked around me.
And I arrived in New York.
At the DSC of the photo editor of New York Times Magazing, in Cathy Ryan.
Is it Berlin?
In the AIM sede, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock.
In Parigi.
In the "Parifotto" room, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world.
To enter those places where photography is distributed, it's based on contents, and understand how the photographer changes these engratulations.
To find answers, I tried to look beyond.
In addition to the surface of the great common places, the visits of the contemporary.
The selfie, for example, the selfie to get involved, simply to a delirium of psychologists have sustained with the body dismorphism, and to get involved in correlated, like some sociologists have written with the occupational basics of the generation of the millennials, as "Cheitard Ben".
Take a slow look.
The phyto-pintage aesthetics that has signed and still segregates our mobile vision.
This is my dog, Zazi, a victim designed by my photographic experiments, and it's simply the result of a world's world's world's worldwide, or, instead, as it has sustained the social, historical, even economical.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of answers, it's the territory of interpretations.
And from this phenomenon, I tried to give an interpretation in a book.
It's called "Revolution," I mean, for a story of the photographer, because in front of the excessant flow of images we are exposed, it seemed to me useful to try to draw a map, if not to find the route, at least to understand what we are.
And how are we?
The story of Mobile photography is short, but in a few years I've invented millions and millions of people.
A new code that exceeds every linguistic barrier, used daily to communicate, testify themselves, to feed a constant flow of images that put in communication the individuals of an angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collective world, if you want, that has impressive numbers.
Every two minutes, today, we climb more images of how many Americans have taken in the burden of the year 20th century.
More than 350 million of these images are carried every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production, the diffusion of images, of activities that, until a few years ago, looked at a right search for professionals.
It became an instinctive of the action of our daily experience.
A form of social interaction.
A channel of proof of our private sphere in public dimension.
In which we define ourselves through the images we produce, or better.
We exist because we produce images.
And if the photographer is a new language, then it's the mother language of the liquid man.
In a contemporary that is still strongly signed by that structure, work, family, coppy, are always more fascinating, and here actors are unstable points in a universe in movement, sponsorships in front of the media of the messages that affect them daily.
The flow of the photographer Mobbai looks like the most natural expression, a liquid vision that is composed of compounds.
It's constantly based on the instant gratification of our sharing need.
But in a world where each one, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone.
That the rule remains the professional photographer and that differences pass through accidental and conscious photographs.
On the one hand, the facility of using the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing professionals the universal language.
Forting to fulfill that process of democratization of photography, I started with Lera Kodak and arrived until the iPhone.
On the other hand.
The use of cell phone as a reward tool offered to professional photographers.
Nine possibilities in approach to stories, the contents, the subjects.
Now, on one hand.
The opening to everyone, to all of us, of a dialogue channel, with a potentially global audience, has moved the professional photographer of their exclusive void.
Like a producer of images.
It has put them in crisis the social function, the economic position.
We just need to think of the rule that had the photographer and social network in the first Arab Spring.
I'm showing you that being a powerful tool to orient public opinion and a capture of information machines, difficultly controlled by the kings, this is an image of threshold, dedicated to the rule of the photographer Mobile in the first Arabic.
But on the other hand.
Let's think that the possibility of direct interaction through the web, through Instagram, between the photographer and the audience, has liberated the photographer from the obliged passage.
For the hands of the editor, the liberated by the need to undertake a political agenda, a editorial line detected by others, and not always based on journalistic priorities, I've liberated it from the impossibilities to reach the destinations of their own message, if it has not through traditional channels, like measures, megae, daily, galleries, of access and limited resources.
And he allowed them to put themselves directly in the user's shoes, traveling.
Would you keep visits in real time, an interesting example?
Like, for example, six female photos, an Instagram account based on a American photographer, Research, Courniz, and dedicated to the conservation of the universal heritage of the family to the times of the photographer's memory that has had origin after this experiment.
Nine paths of curatory selection, like 14-1500 Bilfotographers, a international shipwreck for self-professional workers and distributed through iPhone, created by those international photographers around a topic.
But then are the photographs that in the last years have operated this tool with a great authority awareness?
I'm photos like Michael Cristo Fer Brown.
Benjamin Loui.
Orna Vib, who have used and use the smartphone of conflicts, showing how the agility and the description of the middle can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of deepness.
Photography, Metero Coyaama, who, from a simple smartphone, has explored new paths for Newsmaking, creating a well-being platform to put in touch the American soldiers in the south of Afghanistan with their families and create a motor of information from the front of the first hand.
B.G: Bread Sport, inclusive territory of photographs with hyper-performant appearances, and it made a vehicle of intimate narration and minimal narration on the best League of Baispo.
Research Cirnandt, who enjoyed the discretion and manner for the photographer, creating a very personalistic aesthetics.
I'll tell you that it made me a little bit of denouncement, going back to the Afro-American community of Brooklyn, and creating a community that attacks the parts around its work.
It's a goal that uses it daily to build its family album, by putting a reflection on how Instagram changes the facts of our privacy, and the way we build and preserve our visual memory.
Peter of Campo, who, through the African Countain, has shown how the photographer's Mobile, far from limiting simply to generate visited cliches, could also be used to discuss the Western stereotypes.
As they know about Luigi, who has interpreted the Omer's history with the cell phone, telling in the AI series of one of the oldest heritage of the West's history with the new vision tool.
Or like Anastasia Taylor Linde, who photographed the manifestants in Piazza, who, during the protests of Mai-Dan, a beautiful poetry abroad, and contemporary scholarship.
Well, what do these photographs know how to do?
To tell, going to the outskirts of action, or looking for personalized tags on the event, to avoid more than recording.
Creating images that are never straightened to reality, but that are born from a deep interaction between photographer and content to be broadcast on different platforms and reach different audiences.
To make network using the connections in an innovative way.
Putting on the authority exercise for their point of view on the world and the quality of appropriation.
Because anyway, it's the tool that is represented.
Only if the conceptuality and smiled by a solitary writing, articulated in a poetry way.
It can be distinguished from the visible rumor of the bottom that offers us the eyes.
All of this, I believe, makes the difference between a photograph that is: it was reinforced of the real, its bullying, reproduction, its reference and sharing.
And a photograph that, in reality, can still be a cultural metaphor.
Thank you all.
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
What we believe is silence.
Actually, there are 50 "erts" of electric race.
50 Earths that are immediately entered in our lives.
We wake up from the illusion that silence exists.
I'm a mother.
There is no.
So also in this room, those proofs, these seeds, and put a 50-hern day, then you imagine yourself, not, go home after a work day, really stressing.
Imagine your partner, your partner, and then you'll get into the bubble of your bedera and think you're alone, but no.
There's always her, this frequency of 50 Herz.
Because I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible, in our cases, in our lives, but it's more or less this sound.
Now, we have a positive aspect, or better, first of the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist, but we have a positive aspect.
We are never alone, that is, always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Very good, paranoid.
And if we look at it as a drawing, this frequency of 50 Ears is nothing more than a sound wave, a sound wave with a beautiful rich spectrum, with which we can make music, and then I asked myself, "But why?
Why not make us music?
So, I'm a composer of sound colonies, an artist, I'm now a little special, because I've complicated life deciding to make music alone and exclusively through rumor.
What about my parents?
They were divorcing when I was a child.
What about it?
I know, you think this is the classic story in Strappalacre, but it was the revelation of my life, so every complement of the network was no longer there.
A classic complement of network, closed, immobile, before voice, but it becomes my musical tool.
With a joy among the other of my mom, who every roof didn't find the bikes, among the other hand, Macciao, was looking at me from the streaming, which is a great arrival.
Of course, I say, at some point...
But you're going to become a normal person, I try to say.
I tried because I started studying Chitarra.
It's a strong piano.
Then I liked Woody Allen, so I started to create the grandson, the problem I really liked Arenzo Arvor, who wrote a beautiful song in Bigoa, was coming like the first years of study in Genova.
I didn't even abandon Clarinetto.
That's how it's good to not go ...
It was easy to illusion my classmates.
But why did I abandon all this, why did I study and escape from that notation so rigid?
Because there's more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more sponsor in a rumor.
And I like to paragonate it.
To the problems of life.
All of us have attacked them.
A rumor, a failure, something that made us think, but I'm sure that this rumor made us grow much more.
And a smile.
So, what is my mission?
When I'm a child, it's to transform a failure, a rumor in music, and harmonize everything around me.
I would have been able, right?
I'm going to make a beautiful turning point.
And everything would be concluded, but no, I was complicated in this way life.
What is it?
The sound.
But above all?
What is the study, and with the saying, is one of the most difficult senses to understand, but also the most immediate, the most powerful.
To transmit an emotion: our inner eye, the protein of the oceans, our team, reaches the maximum functionality around the fifth week of gesture.
I say, "Twenty weeks of gesture," this means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to listen even before seeing, and this is not a case.
Because the fact must be ready.
I know that the sponsor in life, once born, must be ready to the dark text, it shouldn't be afraid.
It must be ready.
So, in a case, if the mother, during the pregnancy, listened to Pancroco British, didn't know if the child once was born, yes.
It will be listening, for example, Sex Pistols.
Mummy future, I'll give you, and it's a richness that I personally make you attention to the musical choice: wait for the trap, more than the other, OK.
But what is sound?
"Yes."
The sound is that ...
It's all that we're surrounded, and sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what, in our lives, is completely scared.
You don't see, you don't touch.
For me, the colony is time for every day, the rhythm in our partner, the mother who screams us, because the mother screams us, still, always.
All of this is the sound colony of our days.
"Yes."
Of course, the visual is much easier.
We don't know.
The visual is when we enter the system's hair, we say.
It's smaller than how I imagined them.
There's more small than what, there's more small than the man of Milan.
The smaller than San Pietro.
What's your little house, maybe?
It's understood the same as when a person sees me in video, or on stage, and then I tell you about people, and they tell me.
I imagined higher, and of course, even because it would be really impossible.
Going from this budget, the visual ...
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's see!
To imagine our lives, I would like to genuine your ability to observe, so we are in vacation.
We're in the sea, not in case, and we start to...
I have a soccer blog called a drone to take us photos of the foot, in the wise, then it's Lettino, then it's in another perspective, then it's photo from the bottom, we don't do it, but we also do those, then it's the open air, so we call a lot of sensory, but it's a lot of food that had a certain point that, at some point, in the world.
Food, and ...
No one eating doll.
We photograph it.
We look at it.
Let's make many videos.
But we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I teach you a trick: when do you connect with someone?
The best moment to know the person is to stay in silence, that silence that, among the other, doesn't exist: go for two.
To listen.
Close yourself and listen.
Like in this moment.
So, today I'd like to take you with me, I'd like to bring you with me.
It turns around the world, it was evolving.
Your perception of listening.
And I'd like to start by telling you.
The dream of my life, the dream of my life that is born from school.
It's about me.
For the first time, the listening of myself was 2013, I wanted to run away from the History, a series of failures, problems and others.
I've later turned into harmony, but I'm trying to look for a very far place in Italy, so I decided to choose.
A city on the Atlantic.
There was the Atlantis, yes, it's true.
There was still a lot, there was one of the largest cities, culturally.
Artisticly, it's really far from me: Shanghai, decided to participate in a competition, I came to an artistic residence and started the most beautiful years of my life, for a simple fact that, for the first time, I was listening to myself.
So, I didn't have money, I had so much fear: I had an idea, but I was the only one to believe us, and it was the one that would have listened to the sounds of the whole world, of all the cities of the world, creating this project "Sound of City."
And the whole part, really, from the midst of the cities, are a great musical tool to wake up this musical tool, you can enter the last of the cities.
And I'd like to take you to this moment to Shanghai, where for 48 hours, I'm not registered, the sounds of the city.
And I created a sound colony.
So, at this moment?
I want to sound.
Shanghai.
You were still focused on the visual, and this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say that it's a test, it's all collected to the visual.
Now.
There's a city that is certain, you've photographed in every way, and you're asked more than once, but that smoke that comes from the tombs that are made, but the bridge of Brooklyn can sound.
The bridge of Brookly is an executional.
Everything completely online.
And I want to add it to the other.
Or the Counter, who is really touched on the side, is something very important to say.
Mello.
Beautiful, but it's not beautiful because it's on the other side of the world.
It's not magical because it's on the other hand, it's magical because under our eyes every day.
And maybe many of you know a pair of places.
In this picture?
The sound rule is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, going around a city, losing yourself in the same city, well, I knew Genova.
I knew Genova because there were many times, there were absolutely captured many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that, among my favorite cities, now, scaven the applause, I prepare you.
But I started to record the first sounds and the first sounds were given by these children, which in this tube.
Difference, an important part, gave me this audio camp.
And I'll make you feel, before the Greek camp, and then, that's worked.
But now, what's the lab?
And I said, "No.
Let's go to the aircraft.
(Audience talking) Great.
And I like a bit - I've always done it - I'm not normal, I've never been - I've attacked this beautiful, and it has restricted me a very low frequency that has become a synthesiser.
Would they be right?
I'm in the lab.
Of course, Genova is "Morzandis" (Laughter) He wasn't killed, this is a serious thing.
Everyone.
The writing.
That you see constantly in the pity of Ferrari, it's not just a writer, for me it's a great musical tool, and it helped me to support the bit of this colony.
It's more or less like that.
But the last sound, after I really want to sound like Genova, is that of...
All the doors of the port.
That we are used to look at, but the sound is a perception that is opposed to the view, and so I created this microphone.
"No."
In March, for 48 hours.
In Genova's port, I found a sound of a track that gave me a particular frequency that became melody and when it became the melody, it's because putting it in the loop is transformed into what the voice of the colony is gold.
This is its rock and roll.
It's true.
Well, now I wanted to make you feel a genius, mom.
I got to this point, "No.
Here's Genova as a sound.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
So, this is the sound of our passions, in my and your own, and for how many people will tell you that they are rumorous, stuck.
It's really time, I always want to listen to it, and I bring you to listen, thank you!
As it's said Guybek in Italian, but generally used restitution, it's not perfect, but it's the idea, in general, the idea of restitution linked to monetary institution to beneficence, many times, instead, the restitution is linked to restricting what you've done, what you've learned.
(Audience) Yes!
And going from the end of the '90s, in 1999, precisely, this is my son's ages.
At the same time, my monkey organized the funds to pay the asylum material, it was an activity.
Most of them were extraordinary, very heavy, made with many parents, some of them said, "No, because we must help, we must think the common state."
To help the asylum to help the community.
It has collected a million 200,000 readers, because they don't remember 600 euros, and it was one of the efforts of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later, we take the United States, this is now.
It's similar: the same similar school for a close school, this is the biggest child.
And there's a completely different reality, which was extraordinary for us, we realize that it's a totally ordinary reality.
In other words, the thing of the "giveback" of the restitution is very normal.
So the extraordinary effort of an Italian genital is ordinary for all that society, not that the American society is perfect.
Therefore, I said this, the thing of restitution: I've had fortune, I reproduce, I help school.
It helped the university, helped the museum, the the the the the theater, there are all the communities, financially, live of fishing rejection, there are processes, it works, it's not based on this.
I'm ten years old, some of you may have known it, this is the south's launch.
It has the support of the famous Obamaker, Sito who says, "System is the moment."
Trump is trying us very actively to ask ourselves if the system is given to one of the moment.
Obama has launched the famous bank, and there was an incredible technological debate.
They build a site that doesn't work for a few days, but then someone has stopped criticizing that it's easy and normal to try to do and help that it's difficult to study, so it's not worried about these things that don't happen in Italy, it's not a common thing.
This is Time Magazine's coverage.
After that, many would have criticized the experts of technologies sent by Google and other companies have been offered, and I agree with the white house, I wouldn't have the kittened, I've put in the session, I've been in a few weeks, at a decade of the costs.
The extraordinary effort, and not the ordinary, I've seen that I've finished in the TAMEGS and it's very interesting.
I want to explain what was spinning, I'm spinning by people, not yet.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this validity, this bag, and they decided to reproduce the experiences that had filled their lives.
In this case?
They look at the ability to manage big technological systems, complex, unbearable processes.
Do you think it's regretible?
And make them, at the same time, unbearable and unbearable.
It's creating a replicable system that is the USA, from this effort, then it was born.
A replicable system, what we hope to do with us, I want to talk about the word model, because one also implies the models, the ones that have taught us perseverance, the desire to never move, to continue to insist, energy, empathy.
So these are the models that are part of this bag that we have to use, we want to reproduce.
But for me, obviously, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also the factor of Italy.
Almost 20 years old from the History.
The idea of helping was also because I'm Italian.
"Yes."
I wanted to do it: two out of the night, there's no way.
To do or not do, there's no attempt, maybe the Italian thing is to do or not do, there's only to criticize.
Audience: Yes.
A few years later, we're five to meet Mateorence without Francesco, and the Visicom Valli came to the sensibility of the general transformation, something that has discarded us a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of the processes and for the digital transformation of the public administration requires me, because it doesn't come to help us in Italy for a couple of years, I think, it's reflected in my wife's pair, Monica, and I talk to my genius, to get the brief, I decided to apply it, and I decided to apply it, and I didn't get to the Rome for two years.
A topic of...
Ah, Amazon!
But those who have to do it, Molina Amazon, Probono, Maiday, something will give you underwater, these are only many of the phrases, and I have to say that we've also received so much support, so at this moment we're focusing on this part, but there's a positive part, there's been, I was mentally pregnant to the skeptics and to the bubble of people to ask me, but to wait for these bubbles.
But the scientist doesn't have any kind of cinism that characterizes you a certain mentality: "There will never be, of course, you do it because you have rights, I've heard a lot of this kind, and this country will never make it the sense of common good."
And to do things because you think of helping, to improve a situation not only because it's not interested.
And here's it: for the days of you, this is a commissioner, for the most elderly you recognize it, as an extraordinary commission, it's simply because it's their rule that allowed me to be able to take people from the public administration.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is, as the systems from inside don't transform, we want to try to transform them with people who come from outside, where the fact that they don't know the administration public is a asset, and they don't have a suitcase, they've read 25 people, a new world.
Not big, but it's also too small: technological experts around 80% are expected to do legal, legal, governative, communication.
Here you can see the post I had done when, by myself, I started this adventure, I said, because we don't write what I think will happen.
In this way, we want to attract talents, talents that you live in Italy, or that you want to return to what you see, even temporary, to a compensation, a very well-being problem, as you can see.
So I've put myself in the idea, but how do I convince someone to do the same thing I'm doing here, for the other, maybe some of you recognize it, that photography of the mining of the beautiful, that in the '47s, all the United States, all the United States, in this massive sport, of investment and infrastructure?
But did we create the vision?
The operative system of the country, a series of fundamental components that can build simpler services, effective for citizens, public administration and companies, through innovative digital products.
It's a very beautiful vision, in the documentary, it's the blood and blood.
I've continued in my place: soccer field in Salita, but that American soccer, I'm wrong.
And I continued, we'll also have many rules, complicated, sometimes incomprehensible, it's a easy prediction: we must learn to manage with intelligence and bureaucracy, many of them will not understand how public administration works, they've already tried us in many, they've failed in Italy, it doesn't work like that.
And it continues.
Well, we'll get many criticisms: some comments will be useful, others will be tiny and prejudices, the criticisms of the first type riding of people who want to really offer their contribution and have found them a lot.
The second type of color they want to defend the state of the school is that they always see the bubble in the middle of the void.
Or that, simplerly, the power is drawn.
And this is our problem: to teach things that don't work.
Audience: Yes.
Remember this image: the first, men and women on the cover of Time Magazin.
That's it.
So, despite trying to decorate the most possible people through the eye, I received about three,000 questions, and we immediately started to operate: What do we do?
In fact, we take care of Draulica, right?
These are the tubes of the administration public, some of them to do a lot about connecting, because the big problem is that the systems, the applications, anything that should be interconnected, and asylum, don't connect.
(Audience) Yes!
And I'm not only talking about Washington Machim, I'm also talking about people who don't want to explore their own data, their own applications, so it's about introducing the concept, writing it, explaining it, and in years, implementing it, of interruptability, and making so many hydraulic activities.
But we can't also be pictures: to make the services of the beach, in time, you have to do them improving the interface of the tents, making them easier, all these things are done in parallel, but without the tubes, you can't do the chest.
Audience: Yes.
After a few months, in the midst of 2017 we wrote the piano "Trienna" by the Administration Transformation, we did together with the agile of other people who helped us, what does a thing exist?
Two are written in a clear, technological way, but also in the process.
It was the first time.
It's assessed and sponsorized by the government, the anti-lonic chicken has affected the decrease of the present in the minister, the digital transformation is a priority of the government, the triennal piano.
It's been newspaper once a year, because planes can't be static, especially in technology.
And it's appreciated to administrations.
(Laughter) What is this, this is the only way to do the piano in Italy, in the public administration?
But, unfortunately, we can't fly these things, but we can talk to other things: so the trendal piano is put on Guitab, the technology, the technologies of you understand it, it's regulating the rules and read probably three pages of view and connections to other norms in other rules, and at some point there are technological rules that are quite uncomfortable software.
To improve it.
Audience: Yes!
We dedicate ourselves to this moment, particularly, and this is always a part of the piano, to the agitating platforms, which are the digital platforms, they are those things that embrace all the activities of the public administration, the more there will be.
Digital payment is one: electronic cards, electronic letter, which is a habitant platform, the identity to digitalize a platform.
The greatest project we've followed is called the national and resilient population.
"Yes."
Let's put this, analyzing technologically all the data of you, citizens, that at this moment are at 8,000 different sides, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, the only data of the administration, when I'm transferred to a common to the other, I have to.
First of all, what I was managing, manually, then I have to go to the island, the motorization, to all those places, I have to say, all those things I've already had to know.
We're solving a technological solution, then we'll do so much about processes.
Two weeks ago, we made a series Akaton.
where 800 software educators have worked on that brilliant application, they were used in 96 interventions, bug-figsing, so putting problems of software in a world.
A improvement of documentary, and even to new projects: all this leads - that we're talking about sustainability and scalability in the site of beautiful perspective for technological sponsors, out of the History - and it's made in 25 Italian cities, without Francisco, even in Italian, but there are many Italian cities.
For the Italian publication, now there will be a fifth of what would be left, maybe even less.
The future is today, we dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that normally don't limit themselves to do hydraulic, they also enter the boat.
But it's true that the headlines are completed, sorry, I insist, this could be, for example, one of those things that would add to high-pitched version to the digital citizenship, to the data of electronic identity, to Nepher.
It's already functional, and all this is the purpose of making it easier to familyize the interaction between citizens and the public administration.
With a simple interface, we're dreaming a little, because of work we'll really do so much, but it's different from this vision.
A few weeks ago, the storm.
It's been around 150 years since the world was written.
They expect us a lot of people.
Talking about what you think can happen, I was asked to talk about simplification of the lives of every day of the citizens, I took the opportunity to write an article I want to mention to you.
Some fish?
It's a desire or dream, maybe we do it, we want a country where politicians who try to understand the digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rule and not the exception.
In other words, a country where they read recognize and promote the right to innovate, to embrace it.
A country where technological skills are also inside the State and public companies, a country where there are more public and private companies guided by 30 years than for 70 years.
Imagine, in the end, a country where working for public administration is a northern, where better brains make people work in public research centers, which are green and their centers of excellence and innovation.
That brings a development to the country, let's think it's a dream.
And that the components to do all this, digital, technological processes, are really many and maybe too much, but if it's not a dream about which to punish hardly, things can be done.
First to conclude.
(Laughter) This is my mom who belonged to the people who told me, "Don't do it.
But at this point, she's more calm, and I've managed to explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the digital Tinder, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do something.
And if you want information about us, our site is our social, thank you.
And did you know the possibility to make a desire?
One only to change a aspect of your life that doesn't go as you'd like.
What would you change?
And what would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your genius, your own collaborators?
(Laughter) I was sure that I wouldn't have taken all of them, or maybe win them in the muscles, maybe you're looking at them, because here behind you know there's more freedom, raise your hand those who would change their own body, or maybe you're the ones who would change part of it.
(Laughter) (Laughter) More times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
Let's not understand if you'll change the part, and the answer would be because the elementary ones would have a more united family, but the doctors weren't separated.
(Applause)
In the media, I would have wanted to be better, for the pleasure of the youths.
(Laughter) The university wanted to work, but I found myself with the difficulty of access to the job market: I made the university, I wanted to fight to try to understand how to change the things that didn't go well, from what the others thought about me, to the great economical hands, from the interpersonal relationships, to the characteristics that my acquired me until the birth, when I became a psychologist.
But I also put this research to other people, and I realized that they, like me, used three strategies mainly.
But these strategies, if they used in a small dose, could also take some benefits, but if, as most cases happen, were the only three maps to play in front of a crisis, not only they didn't solve anything good, but they ended up maintaining their problem.
The strategy, today, more broadcast, is to lie, we lie it a little bit of everything, that there's crisis, there's no work that's traffic, that makes me believe in a different way, we lie it because there's no mental space, this paralyzes you, typnotizes and wake up to the spot of eye.
I remember a girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything else, who picked her up, who left her, then from the girl with whom she didn't help her, felt like a true ability, and now that she had completely colonized her daily life.
But lamenting for all of us is a bit the great attempt, because with a small effort you can get a great result, to review the rule of the victim that is listened, comfortable, helped.
But be careful.
Can you lament yourself at night or day?
Only or with friends, on the other hand, or in your mind, can you lament something already happened or something that might happen maybe a tomorrow?
You can lament yourself at the roof, or as much more often happens, you can lament yourself in the right.
Because we all have many reasons to be able to lament.
(Laughter) But the truth is that for how much you will make you hardly lament something around you will change, elderly, you won't do anything else than giving more attention to what you say.
Another very objective strategy, when things are not like you, is that of lamenting, presents that someone is at the study of a B piano to save the skin, in the mouth to the magnifying glass.
(Laughter) At the base of this mentality, there's a growing cultural factor, based on which we learned that if something doesn't work well, it's enough to change it, can we manipulate our loved ones, what surrounds us, doesn't like us?
But from that aesthetic rule.
(Laughter) You feel a little further, but why never be in the suffering, take two pillars and we solve it easy?
His wife breaks, divorce.
At the fresh, we all agree how many risks to the palm.
And your child doesn't listen to you, read it.
It's too big to not breathe it, send it from the psychologist, we're here for this, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice is for this profession, to make the world around you get involved in perfection with your demands.
(Laughter) The context inside which this energy strategy, in a very important way, is the relationships of coppy.
I remember one, a copy, during the collapse of which I didn't do anything else than listening to what, according to one, the other would have to change to solve the resources of their future.
And he said, "Yes."
It's true that you're to agree, but not even to prepare yourself in Chinese, which is also a classicone, but she, no.
If you don't look for me if not for that, and you don't know, you don't realize all the things I do for you.
And she, "No, if you don't listen to me, otherwise you'll do another well to meet me, and so you'll see the infinity of a lovely iron that always begins with the same stretched word.
Because we have to show all the equation line of the other, we have to make them see all the problems that should be cured to reproduce our happiness that has kidnapped us.
(Laughter) But the truth is that if this thing we often say it in a good ugly, believing us deeply.
We hardly can change something: elderly, instead of choosing the node at the base of the relationship, we think about a pair of times, because we'll have a life.
full of resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, is to make us feel like a tool to take the head and put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, there's the fear of facing the conflict that would emerge, that we should show our needs, and then what do we deal with them for the common good?
But in this way, we never take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity, and we live in the merce we need others.
(Laughter) I remember a young man in a young man, a young man in a young man, a son of separated parents, who, at the end of the first childhood, had learned to get rid of the love of the other.
In this limited situation, I learned important things, for example, I learned.
To listen, to accept, to think about the motivations between them, even distant from each other, but on the other hand, they never learned to say no to the things they didn't go well, they didn't learn to tell their desires and ambitions, they were always supposed to tell you how many.
It's the strategy that privileges, when things don't go like you're, is to suffer your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you, and instead of all of you, I'll end up failing.
To wake up, to impose your needs, or to suffocate them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say, with the means of cause, because I myself, throughout my life, have abused them, I tell them what happened to me.
One day, the primary of the hospital I collaborated sent me to call and said to me, "If I like to continue the collapse with us, I must accept a transfer here for her, there's no more place, and I'll be able to go there to make a job that wasn't even a big deal with everything I had studied until then.
I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to lament myself, trying to change the idea, adopting them, but sending that other, and even less because I'd never had to accept a commitment that was unbearable for me.
There you go.
But having different results would have had to do different things.
For the first time, of course, on my legs, at that moment, I realized that the secret to change the others.
It's changing yourself, if it was changed me.
The others would also be able to modify, change.
If I had become a super brilliant, competent, complete psychologist, the first one wouldn't send me via, if I had also done it, the thing wouldn't have taken me more.
But if I wasn't that person yet?
But the answer didn't go to the other's fault, but I had to introduce myself to the profound of my responsibilities.
But why things?
They don't change.
But we are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do?
It's in the direction of choosing us.
What do you choose?
How does things cause?
That they don't go like you want.
You choose yourself as a cause of things that are not like you.
This is our bias.
But if I never find the work of the crisis, you're putting the only arts to your disposal.
Now we'll find ourselves alone and in a new language, if reading books, attending courses to acquire new skills, consolidate those who already have, you can work on you to become unique.
Because life is who does it.
Who doesn't do it?
It's enough.
(Laughter) If inside the copy, things don't go well, you think it's the other to do the first step.
It's sending you a message of inadequality, and you're going away, if you're part of you, and maybe your contributions, every day, this simple question.
What can I do today differently to make your best day, then things change, but they don't change, but they change because you are you who have changed before going to the research of their lacks?
Now she's looking for her needs, and then trying to operate, to be able to satisfy them.
And in this way that I create a mental space inside which we can take care of each other instead of making the war, if you are one of those people.
It's clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose the sense of meaning, the things you do.
If you start to yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand which actions you put in the field to preserve them, then the game becomes something inside which you can become the pattern of the table.
It's starting to work on me, considering myself a cause of the things that didn't go as I wanted, instead of their simple effect that I also started to have to be a better person.
When I was writing to the university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to understand them that, with my matter, there were practical tools, sometimes even fast to bring great value inside their lives.
But friends, I met with a couple of...
Of problems, stereotypes, prejudices, psychologist is the doctor of the mates, the psychologist is the doctor of the debts, but I had to talk to a friend, but I went to the park, but what should I do?
I had to lie to myself, or possible that I didn't tell you how beautiful psychology I had to try to change their mental priority, I had to drop my dream: no, I had to.
Instead of learning to speak a language, which was what didn't happen, as they were closer to the agent, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to learn to listen to their needs.
What's the turn of...
A little time, following this direction, I got results for me unimaginable.
And when I finished the collapse with my primary and its transfer, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I didn't know what to do.
I thought about it, and finally I decided.
I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as he understood him.
I'm transferred here.
I went home, I got the computer, and I registered a video I carried on YouTube, in which I spoke about psychology, here for the cronach, I say, to take a few lights, because maybe you think it's...
In a short time, my YouTube channel has become a reference point in Italy for what psychologists look at in video thanks to this thing every day thousands of people are approaching psychology to discuss some of the stereotypes I mentioned before.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm in 79: I divide psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best schools in Italy, and I left my review.
I had to let myself down.
Because, obviously, they saw that my attempt to innovate the profession in a way to communicate it had something sense, and in Lombardia I was read to the president's vice-Colce: dreams.
But they don't become reality, why?
For example, fortunately, or because you've had that.
The theory that you have to have is the one that keeps moving forward, who doesn't know how you build and needs to distrugle yourself, because the culprit should do it.
If there's something I've learned from all this: it's also so much to discuss your identity, your points of belonging to your certainties, your habits of always, inner journey.
It's that the most important transition, maybe the most delicate, but also the most urgent.
It must come to our internal.
Ten minutes ago I asked you a question: if I had the chance to express a desire, one only to modify a aspect of your life that doesn't go as a forest?
What would you change, have we talked about work, physical perspective, of the current story?
(Laughter) Well, in fact, I'd like to leave you with a gift, at least to prove it, it's a small question that was personally useful, and that is based on the logic that, to get to produce big changes, it's about many small actions.
But what's the smallest thing?
And more simple.
That you could do until now, until the end of the afternoon, to return home after this beautiful newspaper, and that will allow you to take the first step.
To put your life in the direction?
Here you're explaining.
You can think, what is the smallest, the simplest thing you can do to put your life in the direction you live.
CD.
"Oh, you're the keys of the fridge, you're sending it."
I've been part of the pull, right, but where do you put the bags?
The mathematicians are the problems.
Obviously, now I call you.
Or your ugly, what's time to change?
I did it when I arrived to my mother.
But do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to talk for eight minutes.
And I said, "What is this?
I want to take this time by myself, here.
I had a dream.
To create a integration band.
A lot of diversity and diversity.
The percussions are so fast, so immediate, they take the distances and unite the battles.
Are we leaving?
We're lost in seven.
If you were young, I see them, I see them, Laura, Paola, Daniele, I saw them grow.
Our proofs were Mars Day, the day of prove, where this stadium was entered in the Music of Andreoli.
So we picked up the first bidons, we were together, the first waves together.
Then we decided to become a good mark.
KP: From there, we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical brands and travels: the first businesses, the first brands in good pieces, the first satisfaction, the first encounters.
The first satisfaction for the kids, for us, for everything we were doing.
But above all, the first applause.
Unfortunately, a night of the 20th of 2012, the world fell down.
It's in the real sense of the word.
All the cases were completely unbearable or crowned: a strong earthquake scope made our earths.
And from that moment on, we were the earthquakes of the thousands.
For all the inequalities, we were called this.
As I said, the houses were...
Not more agible.
Many crossed: our proof room, our place where there were all the marks and it was completely district.
The tools were inside.
What did we do?
I, the Sahara, Marco, Fede, Matteo, we all looked for them.
You have them in doppoli and the roads.
We were able.
Luckily, we found them all.
Audience: Yes.
We're all finished inside a tender, in a tender, in the seventh of the end of the middle, inside that tender.
There are magnificent things.
We've seen fear sounding stronger.
Because the flag of the colors sounds stronger than the earthquake: they looked at us in the eyes.
With the Earth that was shaking to look for a smile, a look.
The Earth was shaking.
Is it there?
We built the first tools.
The scary cests.
They became houses in the bank.
From the tubes that have become...
The tools built and suited with ping pong racks, to remove them made with big houses, crashed.
We were constantly.
In continuous work, always, there was an amazing energy.
Although we were at a terrible moment.
(Applause)
The inside was born in our first protocol.
We decided to put on a real sponsor.
However, the group's components were increasing, the friends spent the word of 20 that we were, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We are part of the construction of the first protocol: the white.
Because it's the white man, because there were the smallest loops, the biggest loops and the white genius.
At that moment, we all moved together.
Like a blank of lights.
Then, immediately after?
What did we do?
Last year, we did the high school, the swarm.
We became all marine.
Because we really wanted to navigate.
And to move for a moment of our Earth.
To breathe for a moment.
Then, the year later, we made a crack, this marine monster, immediately after.
50 speakers, this flying ship.
And to conclude, that of this year, the sea of the Moon.
The sea of the Moon.
We wanted to close a second on this Moon and look at the sea.
There are many things inside this tenderness.
And none of us would never have thought that a tender could change life, but we did it.
But I want to tell you one thing.
The minutes are finishing.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems to me a favola.
Audience: Yes.
150 concerts spinning in Italy.
The first magician stage.
The concert in the TV program at home.
And the mother's stage?
And we really did so many.
And also to me, leaving the reals, because this is exactly true.
And it's exactly the scenery of life, the factory of the sweat, but also of freshness, that is so much possibility to the future.
So, what happens when a dream becomes reality?
Now I have to go back from the fruits, they expect me.
Is there still so much?
To build, thanks to everyone.
(Applause) One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Firadini, and in fact I was born as a lawyer, until the moment I asked myself what happened in the last 250 years.
250 very important years that changed radically our history, and that we live today, we talk about social innovation, and my question is: What is this social innovation?
And above all, our Italy, which is often so biased, is a ready country to incorporate this digital innovation and ready to be tested at the same time of innovation.
The phone is a technological solution that belongs to the Industrial Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the Internet Revolution, which we're all living in today, and the computer that, in fact, incorporates an evolution that has been extraordinary and has crossed these 250 years, and it's a computer that we still remember as a Ferrovia.
What did we study to me?
In school, in fact, it wasn't just a philosophy: we, at the Industrial Revolution, are huge debates, are normally debates, for example, because we need the vapor motor.
And the vapor motorcycle isn't just a vapor motorcycle, but, for example, that tool that has favored and has become faster, the carbon station, and the network is possible to a highly inferior cost, and it has started to change the modality, but it doesn't make it happen.
The motorcycle is not only the vapor motorcycle, we also need the scope motorcycle, because, on the other hand, it's an Italian invention, it's an Italian investment.
For example, we need the automobilistic industry.
In fact, before the Christmas industry, because the motorcycle was a motorcycle that couldn't leave the farm, when they were able to understand how to make that scent, to realize it as a verb, and it became with the scent that has developed the automobilist industry, and everything that has happened to us.
But not only that.
In the Industrial Revolution, we are still in debates, for example, for the phone, the phone is not only with the tool that allowed us to avoid continuing to see our letters from one part to the other, always more broad than we knew.
But is it also what has allowed us, and has taught us to deposit the caves?
Sout the sea.
And yes, because then we saw the phone, we couldn't try it in the sea, we interrupted everything.
No, if you went forward, standing on the sea, the first cavity, to give a storal dimension, was taken from Italy between medicine and the water, not just two populations that came from agreement, but the first cavity was there.
And we are around 1858.
But I have the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know what it is, we use it, brings our voice, in 187900 subscribed to Rome, is only 1877.
Another intention is electric energy, the first continental power central power in Europe was built via Santa Radagonda, where there is the Milan Rinascente.
Today Gelavinascente, there, a time in 1873 was built the first electric center, in that year, on September 30 was lit the scale.
A part of our history was born from there.
Through the colors that, at the beginning of the '50s, could not be in a stadium like this, and they had already experienced a certain agency, for the other hand, a century of such and even important emotions from the cultural point of view, we sent the computer that was simply faster, the calculator.
But they went forward and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, more intelligent, and they became research contributors, and above all, they started to develop subterraneous reactions, but not underground because they were on the ground, but at some point they decided to open these laws.
And these challenges, called ARPA, the network, became able to bring information to give you an idea: in 1981 they were only 300 the computer connected to the Internet, to give you an idea, in 1995 they were 25 million.
Not many.
Today, it's in the order of the dozens of billion, because we're not talking about the computers we use, but of all these intelligent systems that connect to the network to caricate data, to pick up data or to work data.
But when the mechanical strength began to include the replaced that was introduced by industrial revolution, the artificial intelligence of computers.
And mobility?
That I'm essentially an industrial process that tells us that what is a new progressively destroyed what is old, because we've lived now, that we're living now, but this is the story that a little more human, that belongs to us a little more, on which I try to accompany you.
It was 1863, when, little by little, the Italy hasn't yet made the Italians.
The Minister Mingetti, put in English finances, establishes that the 27th of the Middle Ages, is corresponded to the payment and public dependents.
And from 27 to the next months, that this happens.
And at this moment, even if we don't realize it, we're introducing ministers, something extraordinary, before the wealth of a family, more than a singer, was in their ability to produce good services, which were necessary to their own support.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky of the stages, less risky of the elevation, it started in some way to move away from the Earth.
And above all, it has transformed the economic power to be able to produce goods and services in the power of production of one: the denial.
But there's a second aspect, which is the fridge for us, and that it's not only the object that frees us from the emergency of going to do the spirit every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to preserve, in a massive way, in a healthy way, in quantity of food, which has been the fridge.
So it gives us the possibility, once again, to focus on something that is not immediately the use of the daily life.
This is the man who begins to live to the end of 900, these are us.
At the time, as we said, the speed, the speed of the reactions, the speed of the movements, the speed of our movement, the speed of our movement, and then there's a figure that has characterized these years, there's an element that we can define as the qualification of these years, the speed of our thinking that is not said quality of thinking, but we are very fast.
But when something happened, typically, when the story is watched, to understand the passengers of a century to the other, and to see the data that are not necessarily zero, 1900,000,900,000, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary school, 2001.
But the American economy started to slow down, and on the other hand, there were Torri Gemelli, and so something in balance has started to change: these equilibrium that seemed solid, we realized that they were very fragile.
But we went forward until there was something that has slowed all the time, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world, and the oriental world together, had never met, there was no only America to have slowed, almost closed, there was also the orientation.
In other words, there were European states that were to fail, the Greece was already the leaves of failure, they don't talk about it, but it's still there, and changed something, but what has changed, the economic paradigm, we couldn't.
But not to wait for the biggest economic crisis that, in fact, was verified in 2008 and was crazy not to think about it, but how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension when we can do everything?
With many less people.
It was obvious that it would be broken: we were blind, we didn't know how to wait, look at these companies.
These companies are unbelievable, inventing something, they didn't innovate building something that wasn't there, but above all, they are all companies that are Dante after 2011, but they started to do what we've always done, to buy, to travel, learn.
The different way, the most efficient way.
We try to look at the state of absolute and digital details, according to 5 factors, connectivity, we are 10 percentual points under the media, but, honestly, we are almost close to a fast connection for 50 percent.
There's still something: according to human skills, human resources, competences, competences of curving it, of a different being, between advanced skills and basic skills, with what allow us to develop, we use it.
In other words, a fourth element is the inclusion of the digital factor in productive processes.
So, comets, or industrialization of products and services, the fifth is digitalization.
On the other hand, connectivity, we've said it, we're growing fast, there are new operators, new competitions, a very important competition, there are two factors that we have to look at with great attention that will be created for our future of countries, and are the skills and the inclusion of the digital in the productive facts.
And in this, we have to pay a lot of attention to the characteristics of our country, we have two engines.
And what's done in the 50s is the small companies.
They know how to do something extraordinary that is the Made in Italy, they're not affordable to large multinational companies, in fact, they're probably not useful, it's not effective to interceive the speed of change, they're agile, they're speeds in the production of products, they're small, they're small, they're all want it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, competence inside these realities, because these realities can become those multinationals that can help a technological heritage, we can't digitalize the cloth.
But is it possible that tourists visit only three cities?
I believe that this is the greatest need to recover, to include this heritage inside a knowledge system that allows us to take it and enjoy it, to make it noise, and to bring tourism not only to visit three centers, but to visit all our country.
The topic I spoke about in a certain sense is the opposite act of the word that unites all this.
Our encounter is the opposite of the word "share," because I'll talk not about sharing, but in a certain sense of the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'll talk about inequality, I'd like to start first.
But if someone asked you, and if I asked you, but in Italy, with Abruciapelo, we say in the 21st century, the inequalities in the world, the inequalities, maybe, will reach the precious goal, are increased in a exponential way, or are also decreased.
I asked myself these questions in the last few years, and with the only 24th and the Foundation of video, I prepared with my friends a report on the inequalities from the majority of the countries in the world.
Audience: Yes.
The result is what you see.
This is the curve of the disguised inequality between the citizens of the world, as you can see, there was indeed an increase in inequalities, especially in the 80s, but from the end of the last year, precipitated, now we are at the least storage.
In Italy, we must understand that inequality is quite complicated, even here we have an increase throughout the 80s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second public.
(Laughter) We have a decreasing inequality trend.
How can we read these data?
Well, it's a possible reading is to say that many of us, the same, and it's true, surely in this reading, but we could also ask ourselves another question, and if the feeling of a moment of inequality we've taken a collective bathroom, because we continue to talk about years of increase inequality, how much data doesn't support our feeling.
Let's try, it wasn't wrong the feeling, but maybe the idea of inequality in which ...
We think we're right.
Maybe we have to reflect on the issue of inequality, on what we understand, for inequality, maybe the concept of inequality requires some rethink.
We leave this question temporary and we move around a century.
And also, we move to Cambridge in 1928, a year before the great Church of the 29th, Lickens.
The first one says, "There's a discourse in front of a student audience, a discourse has become famous with the title "The Economic possibilities for our taxes."
In a century, the productivity of a workplace will be...
And he saw a problem for this, because the question that was asked Keynes, but with all this time, in some case, there was a huge amount of there, that is to say, a week of 15 hours of work, well, and this profession was done because if you were going to work well or not.
Apparently, this second thirsty hasn't been made.
Because we all see it, and it's certainly false, but the first part we'll work a lot less, we'll work three hours a day, we're sure that it's not done anywhere, we'll see that happens in Italy.
This curve, this trajectory, represents the fraction of time.
And the interesting thing is that this 16% that a average Italian dedicates to work in the course of our lives, to work, makes two hours and a fourth a day, which is the barrier of the three hours in Italy, we've already spilled it.
Naturally, if this happened like 27 years from the beginning of the last century, from 900, there's another reason, then very positive, and other banals, if you want, obviously, until 25 or 30 years old, so there's also a more fundamental reason for our fourth time.
Dedicated to work and crowned.
And it's the test of occupation, that is, the number of people who work.
This is the storal series of total occupation.
It's built for this occasion and this dramatic series, because it makes you see what?
At the beginning of the century, in all monarchical era, before the Second World War, the occupation rate was always higher than 50 percent.
But a rate of inferior occupation to 50 percent, what does it mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, that is, pure consumers who don't perceive any network are more workers.
In front of this?
In fact, storal, we can also have a relationship.
But then we see if, in the country that the problem of modernity, that is in the United States, things have been in the same way, because if this interpretation is fair, it should have happened in the United States, between Italy and progress.
It was united: this is the storal series of time.
It's dedicated to work in life, as you can see, and the United States only calms up to the 30s, then it's established, and the storal series of the occupation rate, because here we see.
There's an increase, that small one you see below is the crisis of the 29th, but after the crisis of the 29th, we have a general tendency of the occupation rate in the United States at the increase, but in our case we have a situation of reduction.
The occupation task.
But then, this is a pathology.
It's not normal.
"What?"
But they are more people who consume without producing than the people who produce.
It's not normal that the majority of the population lives in a condition that I'll define, dependence in parassitary, dependence, because, depending on the network of Twisia, this one can also be a family or the State, but it's parassitarian.
If you want to have an idea of how theater is behaved, when I found these results, we'll have dinner and I asked them, "But how do you represent this situation with an image, a situation of parassitary dependence, and he will be here?"
The bubble or the bubble on the prototype, or on the other big mammals, these birds also live on the broken rhythms, on the bubbles, well, we have this film that will treat us for a few seconds.
These fish.
As they live, if the bubble is happy with the eye, which can mean that it's playing, whether it's invested by the light, but I'm not an ethology, I do what happens in nature, but I'm not an ethology, I do what happens in nature.
And society, ladies and gentlemen, as the feudal society in which there's a society in which there's this kind of productive consumer, the first one, there's a society that has put in the condition of living without working, but naturally it's not enough, you have to add a qualification.
That it could be defined by ignorant society, but it's a mass society.
And here the clear report is a relationship between the gentlemen and the producers is much more complicated, because the consumers are more than the producers: classic society, we have the gentleman and the serves of the jungle that produce for him, in society, and in the society, gentlemen, they have become many.
The relationship?
From bubble with the hypothesis and parasitism, and this is a advantage signed in green, but it's also dependence, because it depends on food that is in the sphere of the airport.
Because we can't, we don't need bubble, but it's in some way, in a report of obligation, as we are, in the face of color we maintain, the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of legacy double, but a situation.
That doesn't go well.
Is it a situation in which?
And the best situation in this scale, in this scale of inequality of access to work and dramatic access to work, with the United States, in the middle, there is a new problem of inequality, that is to calculate a concentration of genius, which is the tool with which inequality can be applied to work, there are people who don't work, who have two jobs.
They need us to become an Oxis country, normal, seven million jobs.
How did we get to this: this is the story of inequality of access to work in Italy, always measured in any kind of genius, you can see something clamorous, that inequality is the minimum, during the work positions in more, our families?
But here I conclude, they would perceive 1,000 euro a month, in more, we would have 12,000 euros to spend, as much as the health and the school put together, more or less in Italy, there's one.
NJ: No.
We have the scholarship to write in the first article of the Constitution, "The Italy is a democratic Republic based on work, we are the only country."
It has this in the first title of the Constitution, and we are the worst country together with the Turkey of the West.
The seven million posts for which, and we believe, because being so things sound like a bubble.
Thank you.
