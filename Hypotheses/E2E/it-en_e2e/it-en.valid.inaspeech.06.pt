In 2016, I was given a award: from the National Forum Forticing Learning, supported by the Ministry of Education in Irlanda, from the name a little particular, they were born in Church.
The motivation of this award was my availability in the confrontation of the students and my ability to create data environments.
Less formal, more relaxing, let's imagine that this is.
A big university class.
So, usually, I go to class.
The first ten minutes, when the students enter.
Yes, it's.
I put my computer to explain and put a classic music.
I think this is the first step to create data environments, less forming the most reassuring, and try to maintain the attention of the students.
Unfortunately, it's not always easy.
AC: During my lessons, I use a method used at the end of the old age.
Storietelling.
At a pedagogical level, the storytelling is a method based on the use of narratives.
To transmit knowledge to students.
And it's precisely with this method that I'd like to start my lesson explaining to you to describe a topic about the mouth of everyone, already.
Artificial intelligence.
Like all the stories that children tell, I'd like to start my story.
There was once.
Second World War.
1942.
The UK region.
Blockchain Park.
A ...
Resilience in northern London.
There was a young, 30 years old.
Alan Turing.
Let's see here in Cambridge's school.
And they get a research doctor in logic, at the Prince University, in America.
At that time, the Tedes used a machine.
Special.
Enigma.
It was like a writing machine.
The operator digitalized details.
But let's get stuck on a paper.
In fact, those letters are stuck other letters, according to them.
A code imposed mechanically under the car.
The texts used this mechanism.
To communicate with them.
But anyone would interceive this paper in front of you without any sense.
It was shouting.
Alan Turing.
It was one.
One of the main figures in Blockchain Park.
What's your team?
And I built them a machine.
The one you can see.
And there's another one.
Let's decipher.
With this thesis written by the Tedesque.
For this invention, we think that war is finished with two years of anticipation.
It's saving many human quickly.
In the adventure, continuously, after the war, to do its logical research.
And it's considered the father of computer science, the father of artificial intelligence.
With your Turing machine.
And it formalizes the concept of computer, even before the computer was created in practice.
In 1950.
It publish an article on the magazine "Mind".
The computer in the machine is in intelligence.
Where does the test come from?
The question behind the testing is a very precise one.
They can think.
From here, artificial intelligence began.
Probably many of you have seen the movie of Emitation Game, the game of limitation, I want to explain to you.
Let's suppose there's a person here?
FDigitality is the computer.
It asks that it puts questions, and on the other hand, a machine M.
It's an operator.
In an alternative way, the machine M and the October.
They provide the answers to the person.
It's said that the machine takes over that Testituring if the person is not able to understand when the answers come from the machine and when the answers come from the operator.
This is limiting a game.
The machine must have special characteristics to overcome the test.
You must interpret the natural language.
The question that comes from the person.
It must represent knowledge to form the answers.
It must think in an automatic way to form these answers.
And it must learn automatically.
There are different approaches.
To study artificial intelligence.
One of these is the cognitive approach.
It's based on human thinking.
According to this process, there are two ways to study human thinking, or we try to capture thinking.
In the moment they are born.
Or we try to modify the thinking at a psychological level.
That's why artificial intelligence is highly connected to cognitive neural science and psychology.
According to this approach, the assunction that if we can really have a female representation of human thinking, then we can transfer it to a machine.
Another approach is the approach of the laws of rational thinking.
Probably many of you.
They've heard of Aristotle's sillogism.
Socrates is a man.
All the men are mortal.
Socrates are mortal.
This is a deductive argument.
Take two premises.
Let's see.
It's dedicated to a real conclusion: from here the logic of the whole, according to the approach of the legs of the thought.
It's trying to build educational arguments.
And to see them in a car.
Another approach is the approach of rational agents.
A rational agent?
An entity.
(Laughter) It must act.
It must be adapted to the context.
It must be part of the goals.
And knowing how to bring terminals?
And it must act in a rational way.
So TestD Turing is linked to intelligent people.
Reformulating the phrase of Turing, a machine to think.
We can say, "Can we create a machine?"
An artificial agent.
I'm able to think.
To exhibit intelligence and rationality.
Artificial intelligence, so yes, has the purpose of creating entity.
Artificial intelligence, your phone is an entity.
Among the construction of artificial entities, we try to understand intelligence as psychological constructions.
Once we have more knowledge.
What about this?
What's the thing?
It's close to build entities.
Artificial intelligence is supported by humans.
It's a cycle.
But let's see today.
If machines can think.
I'd like to explain to you to describe the state of art, artificial intelligence, and I'd like to use.
Five classes to classify artificial agents according to their abilities.
We have subtle agents.
Stop human beings.
Sovereignity.
Superhuman.
Finally, we have optimal agents.
Let's take this with some example.
Other animals are the agents that act better than all men.
And I can't do it.
For example, people who used the cube of Rubik play with a four-year-old strength in the best way, play a sad, think that a few years ago a young man has rescued.
It was the beginning of the Rubik cube, it has rescued it in 4.73 seconds.
A few months ago, they created an agent, a robot that was able to solve in zero,63 seconds.
We have the sovereign agents.
They act better than all people.
For example, it's a game of the rocks.
In the game of the scarabet.
A few years ago, the championship ...
Russian diskis, Gaspar Pissad, knocked from a artificial agent.
We have human agents.
The ones that exist almost like all people, for example, in the Power Texano game.
I'll answer the question of the quiz.
We have people for humanity.
Who do they act?
Almost like all people.
For example.
In cognitive activities, like the crowned words.
Or the image classification?
Finally, we have subtle people who manage the worst of all people.
Exemples are the classification of objects.
The recognition of caligraphy, the vocal recognition, the translation of a language to the other.
But if there's something that artificial agents, today, are not able to do, for example, is disambiguation.
We're talking about the result.
How is it?
The mum!
Are we talking about it?
It's the Mark of Apple Corporation.
And one thing that agents are not able to do is the reasoning in the ideal world, in uncertainty situations.
These are the greatest limitations of artificial intelligence, for which we think we are far from overcoming the test.
Let's see now in the future.
They will be able to think.
A few years ago.
In America, a thing was introduced.
From the technological name: Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest ones.
Experts of artificial intelligence in the world.
Imagine the time line.
Imagine a line.
That indicates the human intelligence ascending.
Now imagine.
A red line that indicates the machine intelligence.
With an exponential ambition.
This is a blind moment.
The challenge.
I predicted in the wall's leg.
That's why.
The computer complexity, for example, measured with the number of transistors inside a chip, radiated in the two years and in four years.
According to Ray Kurzweil, in 2010, we had to be able to...
It's the use of this computer complexity to simulate human brain.
I don't see it.
In 2020 we would have access to 1,000 dolls to this computer capacity.
In 2025, secondary and crossed, I'll never be able to get rid of our brain in a precise way.
And finally, in 2029.
The machines will spend the test, they will overcome the test.
And then?
In 2045, and the indication, the moment in which technology will have.
In which machines will follow the intelligence of the machines and follow an exponential environment that will radically change.
Human intelligence.
In his article.
It's published on the mind magazine.
Turing.
Not only proposed their tests.
But it also proposes new objections.
Contering your same test.
These objections are us against artificial intelligence.
Any year ago?
I was a student at the University of Varese.
I followed a path of epitimology, deontology and ethics of computer science, had such a Gaithan professor, Aur√©lio Lanzerone.
Unfortunately, a few years ago, one of the compounds we had to move was to propose a decade of obedience.
With the test of Turing, with artificial intelligence, I was the only one that proposed ...
A decim formulated objection with mathematics.
It's the human stupidity.
Let's talk about writing in simple terminals: let's suppose to take the intelligence of all people?
Let's put the seed.
It's the symbol of summers to the minister of equations.
And we transfer all this intelligence inside a machine.
So we got it.
An intelligence equality, but in some way the machine becomes more intelligent than us.
But if it's true that we were us?
To transfer our intelligence inside a machine.
And this becomes more intelligent than us.
It's also true that we left the machine become more intelligent than us.
So to conclude my story.
Let me ask myself to the initial question.
They can think about them.
I'd like to leave you.
With a open question.
It really makes sense to let them think.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
But how many of you today have taken pictures?
Thank you.
Okay.
Well, this gives me more or less the measure of not having worked completely in the bathroom, and it all saves me the creative director of a study that takes care of photography, and it's a person who has taken so many photos with their phone, which doesn't do absolutely me in a photographer, I've spent the last three years.
This is me, immersed among my maps, to take care of a liquid matter, the photography, which is the product and broadcast through the cell phone.
Her limits, their contradictions, their potentialities, their impact on the market, their projectual and authority.
But that sense can have, try to understand a contemporary or contemporary contemporary that changes while we're here to discuss, this is only one of the questions I've asked myself in these three years and that interests me to share with you, but there are many others, in which we change the processes through which we communicate.
We can consider the photographer a new language, in order to influence theesthetics of the vision that forms of communication, the technical consciousness there is.
In the production of a scenario, from a professional photographer.
It's still the difference regarding the simple gesture of a pulseer on a smartphone.
And how does photography change the forms and the structure of professional photography?
To find answers to these questions, I tried to open a confrontation.
With pictures, rescuers, criticisms, theories that deserve the photographer had the way to elaborate experiences and reflections.
The professionals, instead, that for the first ten years, have embraced the challenge of this new means.
I asked them to share with me the anatomy of their projects, the reasons of their formal choices, the successes, of their production and sharing of images through the cell phone.
To find answers, I looked around me.
And I arrived in New York.
At the DSC of the photo editor of New York Times Magazing, in Cathy Ryan.
Is it Berlin?
In the AIM sede, one of the greatest actors in the new market of Mobin Stock.
In Parigi.
In the salt of Parifot, one of the most prestigious fears of photography in the world.
To enter those places where photography is distributed, it's based on contents, and understand how the photographer changes these engratulations.
To find answers, I tried to look beyond.
In addition to the surface of the great common places, the visits of the contemporary.
For example, the selfie.
The selfie is to get involved, simply, to an artistic delirium correlated, like some sociologists have written with the occupational bass of the generation of the millennials, or can't be seen as a health of segments.
Like an identical stadium.
Like a overwhelming reappropriation of their own image, as it's joyfully reivindicated by visual artists, feminists, like "Keitard Ben."
Hi, Shh Laga.
The phyto-pintage aesthetics that has signed and still segregates our mobile vision.
This is my dog, Zazi, a victim designed by my photographic experiments, and it's simply the result of a world's world's world's worldwide.
However, as the social sociologist was born in New Yorkson, it can't be read to the most complex factors of social and historical nature, even economical.
But photography, I believe, is not the territory of answers, it's the territory of interpretations.
And from this phenomenon, I tried to give an interpretation in a book.
Because it's called "Revolution," I mean, for a story of the photographer, because in front of the excessing image we're exposed, it seemed to me to try to draw a map, if not to find the route, at least to understand what we are.
And how are we?
The story of Mobile photography is short, but in a few years I've invented millions and millions of people.
A new code that exceeds every linguistic barrier, used daily to communicate, to test ourselves, to feed a constant flow of images that make individuals from an angle to the other of the planet.
A global dialogue, I have a collective world, if you want, that has impressive numbers.
Every two minutes, today, we climb more images of how many Americans have taken in the burden of the year 20th century.
In addition to 350 million of these images are carried every day on Facebook, more than 70 million on Instagram.
The production, the diffusion of images, of activities that, until a few years ago, looked at a right search for professionals.
It became an instinct of action of our daily experience.
A form of social interaction.
A channel of proof of our private sphere in public dimension.
In which we define ourselves through the images we produce.
Or better.
We exist because we produce images.
And if the photographer is a new language, then it's the mother language of the free man.
In the contemporary, which is still strongly drawn by that process of liquid and action.
Of the certainties, that's how brilliantly individualed by the Zygmunt Pound.
It's as a typical of a modernity, where structures, work, family, coppy are always easier, and here actors are unstable points in a universe in movement, sponsored in front of the media of the messages that affect them daily.
The flow of the photographer looks like the form of more natural expression.
A liquid vision that is composed of compounds.
It's constantly based on the instant gratification of our need of sharing.
But in a world where each one, at any moment, can record and share any event with their cell phone.
What's the professional photographer?
And what difference does it happen between accidental and conscious photographs?
On the one hand, the facility of using the cell phone camera has transformed the photography of mixing professionals the universal language.
By contributing to understanding the process of democratization of photography.
I started with the era Kodak and arrived until the iPhone.
On the other hand.
The use of cell phone as a reward tool offered to professional photographers.
Nine possibilities in approach to stories, to the contents, to the subjects.
Now, on one hand.
The opening to everyone, to all of us, of a dialogue channel, with a potentially global audience, has moved the professional photographer of their exclusive void.
Like a magical distributor.
It has put them in crisis the social function, the position of the economy.
It's enough to think of the rule that had the photographer and social network in the first Arab Spring.
Difference to be.
A powerful tool to orient public opinion is to capture the sources of machines and information, difficultly controlled by the Greeks.
This is an image of Iro thinking, a show that the Folfang museum of SN has dedicated to the role of the photographer in the first summer.
On the other hand, but...
Let's think that the possibility of direct interaction through the web, through Instagram, between the photographer and the audience, has liberated the photographer from the obliged passage.
For the hands of the leg.
From the editor, the liberated from the need to undertake a political agenda, an editorial line detected by others, and not always based on journalistic priorities.
I've liberated it from the impossibility of reaching the destinies of their own message if it doesn't cross traditional channels, like seeds of information, megazens, daily, galleries, of access and limited resources.
And he allowed them to put themselves directly in the user's shoes, traveling.
Would you keep visits in real time, an interesting example?
The offer is the magazine Time, in 2012, with the cover, I saw the Instagram in real time through the T-E-COber's mechanism, its own images, deligning a new model of Newsmaking and visualism, the reality in journalism.
This is the book machine that has had origin after this experiment, and if it's true that in the radiation of the family photography, at the time of the iconographic photography, every photographer, through a new level of universal heritage of a global comer, in which we read the evolution of photography and society in the 90s.
Or they are born names.
Nine paths of curatory selection, like 14/1500 Bilfotographers, created by two Italian photographers, Giulio Napolitan and George Posulic, through a job of scavenging in the highest levels of potential and narrative photographers around a topic.
But then are the photographs that in the last years have operated this tool with a great authority awareness?
I'm photos like Michael Cristophe Brown.
Let's take it.
Oronna Vie.
That they have used and use the smartphone, the conflict territories, showing how the agility and the description of the means can make the difference in terms of personal security and quality of deepness.
Photography as Tero Coyaama, who belongs to a simple smartphone, has explored new paths for Newsmaking, creating a well-being platform to put in touch the American soldiers in the south of Afghanistan with their families and create a motor of information from the front of the first hand.
Pread Mengin, who used it for sport photography, exclusive territory of photographers with hyper-performant appearances, and made a vehicle of intimate narration and minimal narration on the best basis link.
Research Corte Ernandt, who enjoyed the description and manner for the photographer, creating a very personalistic aesthetics.
I'll tell you that he made a small report, going back to the American community of Brooklyn, and creating a community waiting for the parts around his job.
It's a goal that uses it daily to build its family album, by putting a reflection on how Instagram changes the facts of our privacy, and the way we build and preserve our visual memory.
Peter of Campo, who, through the African Country, has shown how the photographer, far from limiting simply to generate visited cliches, could also be used to discuss the Western stereotypes on the crisis and the famine.
As they know about Luigi, who has interpreted the Omer's history with the cell phone, telling in the AI series of one of the oldest heritage of the West's history with the new vision tool.
Or as I was born in Lourlin, who photographed the manifesting smooths in Piazza, who, during the protests of Mai-Tan, with a beautiful puzzle, and contemporary scholarship.
Well, what do these photographs know how to do?
To tell, going to the outskirts of action, or looking for personalized tags on the wind.
To avoid more than recording.
Creating images that are never straightened to reality, but that are born from a profound interaction between photography and context, between photography and subject.
Contaminating creatively the codes of the storytelling, designing in a media fat thinking and performing their contents to be broadcast on different platforms and reaching different audiences.
To make network using innovative connections.
Putting on the author's exercise for its own point of view on the world.
And on the quality of depth.
Because anyway, it's the tool that represents pregnancy.
Only if the intellectuality photographer and smiled by a solid writing, articulated in a poetry way.
It can be distinguished.
From the visible rumor of the bottom that fights us.
All of this, I believe.
It's still the difference between a photograph.
It was the real resource.
Her bullying, reproduction, her self-referent and sharing.
And a photograph that, in reality, can still be a cultural metaphor.
Do you feel it?
Do you feel this?
What we believe is to be silence.
Actually, there are 50 "erts" of black race.
In the 50s, which were immediately entered.
In our lives.
We wake up from the illusion that silence exists.
A email.
There is no way.
So also in this room, those protests.
These seeds.
It's putting a frequency of 50 ERS.
So, do you imagine yourself, after a job day, really stressful?
You eat, with your partner, with your partner, and then you'll get into the bubble of your bed camera and think you're alone.
But no.
There's always her.
This frequency of 50 Hers.
Because I simply increased volume.
Because it's imperceptible, in our cases, in our lives, but it's more or less this sound.
We have a positive aspect.
Or better, first of the negative aspect: silence doesn't exist.
But we have a positive aspect.
We are never alone, that is, always this beautiful race, this frequency of 50 Earth that accompanies us.
Very good.
It's harmful.
And if we look at it as a drawing, this frequency of 50 Ears is nothing more than a sound wave, a sound wave with a beautiful rich spectrum, with which we can make music, and then I asked myself, "But why?
Why not make us music?
So, I'm a composer of sound colonies, an artist, I'm now a little special, because I've complicated life deciding to make music alone and exclusively through rumor.
My parents?
They were divorcing when I was a child.
"Yes."
I know, you think this is the classic story in Strappalacre, but no, it was the revelation of my life.
Because in loneliness.
From those days, in the weight of the void of that house, I started to make music with everything I surrounded you, so ...
Each income complement was no longer.
A classic complement of network, we fermed, immobile, before the voice.
But it becomes my musical tool.
With a joy among the other of my mom, who every roof didn't find the bikes, among the other hand, Macciao, was looking at me from the streaming, which is a great freedom.
And I say, at some point.
I tried to become a normal person, I try to say.
I tried because I started studying Chitarra.
It's a strong piano.
Then I liked Woody Allen, right?
So I started to create the grandson, the problem I really liked Arenzo Arvor, who wrote a beautiful song in ambiguous, came it like the first years of study in Genova.
I also quit Clarinetto.
It's right like that, not to go ...
It's easy to illusion my classmates.
But why did I abandon all this, why did I study and escape from that notation so rigid?
Because there's more harmony in a rumor.
Because there's more sponsors in a rumor.
And I like to paragonate it.
To the problems of life.
All of us have attacked them.
A rumor, a failure, something that made us think, but I'm sure that this rumor made us grow much more.
And a smile.
So, what is my mission?
After when I'm a child, it's about transforming a failure, a rumor.
In Music.
It's to harmonize everything that is.
I'm stunned.
Let's talk about a beautiful turning point, Gino Paoli.
And everything would be concluded, but no, I was complicated in this way life.
What is it?
The sound.
But above all!
What is the study?
The study is one of the most difficult senses to understand, but also the most immediate, the most easy, the most powerful.
To transmit an emotion.
Our internal eye, the protein of the oceans, our team, reaches the maximum functionality.
Around the fifth week of gesture.
The fifth week of gesture, this means that we start to listen, even before talking, we start to listen even before seeing.
And this is not a case.
Because the fact must be ready.
I know that the hospital, in life, once was born, must be ready to the Nora texture.
It shouldn't be afraid.
It must be unique.
So, in case, if the mother, during the pregnancy, listened to Panchroco British, didn't know if the child once was born.
"Yes."
It will end up listening, for example, Sex Pistol.
Food, moms, I want you, and it's a richness that I personally pay attention to the musical choice: wait for the trap, more than another.
Okay.
But what is sound?
The sound is that ...
It's all that we're surrounded, and sound is the intangible that becomes emotional.
It's what, in our lives, is completely abstract.
You don't see, you don't touch.
Well, the colony is time for every day, the retirements with our partner, the mother who screams us, because the mother screams us, still, always.
All of this is the sound colony of our days.
"Yes."
Of course, the visual is much easier.
We don't know.
The visual is when we enter the system's capella, we say.
It's smaller than how I imagined them.
It's a small man of Milan.
A small San Pietro.
"What about your house, maybe?"
It's understood the same as when a person sees me in video, or on stage, and then I tell you about people and says to me.
I imagined higher, of course, because it would be more low, it would be really impossible.
So?
Going from this presentation.
Is it visible?
It's what allows us to imagine.
But the sound, the study?
It's what allows us to dream.
Let's go!
To imagine our lives, I would like to genuine your ability to observe.
Imbalance.
We're in the sea, not in case, and we start.
I have a soccer blog, who talks about soccer, kilometers, kilometers, kilometers - I'm not, I'm not in another prosecutive, then it's photo of low, but we don't do it, but also those, then it's a slightly football blog that had a certain point.
(Laughter)
No one eating doll.
We photograph it.
We look at it.
Let's take many videos.
But we never stop listening.
We never stop listening.
But not even a person we know.
And I teach you a trick: when do you get it with someone?
The best moment to know the person is to stay in silence, that silence that, among the other, doesn't exist: go for two.
To listen.
Let's stop.
To listen.
Like in this moment.
So, today I'd like to take you with me, I'd like to bring you with me.
It turns around the world, it was evolving.
Your perception?
And I'd like to start by telling you...
The dream of my life.
The story of my life is born.
Is it listening?
It's the last one.
For the first time, the listening of myself.
It was 2013, I wanted to run away from the History, a series of failures, problems and others.
Because then they turned into harmony, but I think I'm going to look for a very far place in Italy.
So, I decided to choose.
A city on the front.
There was the Atlantis.
There was still so much, there was one of the largest cities, culturally.
Artistically, and really far from me.
Shanghai, I decided...
I participated in a competition, I came to an artistic residence and started the most beautiful years of my life, for the simple fact that for the first time I was listening to myself.
So, I didn't have money, I had so much fear: I had an idea, but I was the only one to believe us, and it was the one that would listen to the sounds of the whole world, of all the cities of the world, creating this project of Sound of Syria.
And the whole part, really, from the midst of the cities, are a great musical tool.
To wake up this musical tool, you can enter the last of the cities.
I'd like to take you to this moment to Shanghai, where?
For 48 hours, I'm not registered the sounds of the city.
And I created a colony.
So, at this moment?
I want to sound.
Changage.
You were still focused on the visual, and this was a test.
It's not true, it wasn't a test, but we say it's a test, it's all collected to the visual.
That's it.
There's a city that's sure, you've photographed in every way, and you've asked yourself more than once, but that smoke that comes from the tombs that are done.
But the bridge of Brooklyn can sound.
The bridge of Brooklyn is an executional.
Everything completely online.
And do you want to join it?
Or the Counter, who is really focused on the side, is something very important to say.
Men.
Beautiful, but it's not beautiful because it's on the other side of the world.
It's not magical because it's on the other hand.
It's magical because under our eyes every day.
Maybe many of you...
They know a pair of places.
In this picture?
The sound rule is 48 hours.
Without sleeping, going around a city, losing yourself in the same city, well, I knew Genova.
I knew Genova because there were many times, there were absolutely captured many times, but I've never heard it so profoundly, and listening to it in this way I can tell you that, among my favorite cities, now, scaven the applause, I prepare you.
(Laughter) I started to record the first sounds.
And the first sounds were given to these children, in this tube.
I'm from Ferro, an old man, they gave me this camp.
And I'll make you feel, before the Greek camp, and then the one to work.
Now, what's the workplace?
That's not it.
I left, to the aircraft.
(Audience talking) Great.
And I like a puzzle, I'm part of the fact that...
So normal, I've never been, I've attacked this beautiful man, and it has restricted me a very low frequency that has become a synthesiser.
It's a reaction.
I'm in the lab.
Of course, Genova is Mordandis.
(Laughter) It wasn't a battle, this is a serious thing.
It has given the world.
The writing.
That you see constantly in the pity of Ferrari, it's not just a writer, for me it's a great musical tool, and it helped me to support the bit of this colony.
It's more or less like that.
The last sound, after I really want to sound new, is that of...
The doors' boats.
That we are used to look at, but the sound is a perception that is opposed to the view, and so I created this microphone.
"No."
In March, for 48 hours.
In Genova's port, I found a sound of a track that gave me a particular frequency that became melody, and when it became the melody, it's because putting it in the loop is transformed into what A.
The voice of the colony is no.
This is its rock and roll.
That's it.
Hello, now.
I wanted you to feel a genius, go bad.
This one came to me.
Here's Genova as a sound.
Now you feel this.
Do you feel this sound?
I spend the sound of our passions, in my and your own, and for how many people will tell you that they are rumorous, stuck.
For a long time, you really want to listen to it, and I invite you to listen, thank you!
As it's said Guybek in Italian, the word generally used is restitution, it's not perfect, but the idea of the idea, in generating the idea of restitution linked to monetary restitution to inequality.
Many times, instead, the restitution is related to restricting what you did, what you learned.
And passing from those who say, doesn't work.
Then, in Italy, nothing works in this country, we try it, so the next 18 minutes I shared some point of this story.
But going from the end of the '90s, in 1999, precisely, this is my son's army.
It has rescued, next to Segrate.
In the same year, my monkey organized the funds to pay the material.
And from the asylum.
It was an activity.
Very heavy, made with many parents.
But some of them said, "No, why should we help, we must think about the common state?"
Most of them were extraordinary efforts.
To help the asylum to help the community.
It has collected a million 200,000 readers, because they don't remember 600 euros, and it was one of the efforts of individuals, an extraordinary effort.
A few months later, we take the United States, this is it.
It's similar: the same scenario for a nearby school, this is the biggest child.
Audience: Yes.
And there's a completely different reality, which was extraordinary for us, we realize that it's a totally ordinary reality.
There's the thing of the game Beck, of the restitution.
It's normal.
So the extraordinary effort of an Italian genital is ordinary for all that society.
Not that the American society is perfect.
So much.
I said, this is the thing of restitution: I've had fortune, I'll replace it.
It helps school.
It helps university, it helps the museum, the the the the theater, there are all the communities, financially, live of...
Restitution of volunteer.
There's no volunteer, there's a phenomenon and a positive circle, and then there are also the mechanisms, there's fishing lucidity, there are processes.
It works, it's based on this.
I'm ten years old, some of you may have known it, this is the south's launch.
It has supported the famous Obamaker.
Sit that says, "System is from now on."
Trump is trying to us.
But actively, it's called "System is one of the moment."
Obama is the famous bank, and there was an incredible technological debate.
Technological advance has been 600 million dollar, so not worried about these things that didn't happen only in Italy.
This risk isn't working.
There are so many million contacts, and this is the standard answer they got.
In short, believe it's not finishing for a few days, but then someone stopped criticizing, and it's enough to do it.
Going from criticizing, which is easy and normal to try to do and help, which is difficult, extraordinary.
For us, it's not something common.
This is Time Magazine's coverage.
Refigure the experts of technology that were sent by Google and other companies, they were offered.
And I agree with the Bianca house, I wouldn't have architects, I've put the sid, I've stayed in a few weeks, in a decade of the costs.
After all, many would have criticized, but I'm surely interested in this.
What about it?
The extraordinary effort, and not the ordinary, I've seen that I've finished in the TAMEGS, it's very interesting.
I want to explain what was spinning, I'm spinning by people, not yet.
They learned a lot about their lives, they had this suit, this bag, and they decided to reproduce the experiences that had filled you with their lives.
In this case?
They look at the ability to manage big technological systems, unbearable processes.
Repetible.
And make them, at the same time, unbearable and unbearable.
And creating a replicable system, which is the USA, from this effort, then was born.
The system replicates what we hope to do with us.
I want to talk about the word model.
Because one also implies the models, the ones of our lives that inspired us and taught us.
Those who have taught you perseverance, the desire to never move, to continue to insist, energy, empathy.
So these models are part of this bag that we need to use, we want to reproduce.
For me, obviously, it has played not only what we said until now.
But also the factor of Italy.
It's almost 30 years old from the History.
The idea of helping was also because I'm Italian.
I wanted to do it.
There's no way to find out.
To do or not do, there's no attempt, maybe the Italian river is to do or not do it, there's only to criticize.
A few years later, we are five against San Francisco, and the Visica Avenue to Silicon Valley is essential to the necessary transformation in general.
Something has stopped us a little less.
The transformation that must also happen for the transformation of processes, for the digital transformation of the public administration.
(Laughter) He asks me, "Why don't you help us in Italy for a couple of years?"
I think about it, it's reflected, the pair of my wife, Monica, and I talk to my genius, to have the brief, I decided to apply a choice methodology, so I said, "Don't think I've never tried it."
The choice was made, and so it's been the Rome for two years.
It's a matter of art.
Good afternoon.
But those who have to do it, Mallia, Amazon, Probono, Saymato, but that's what will give you underwater, these are only many phrases, and I have to say that we've also received so much support, so at this moment, we're focusing on this part, but there was a positive part.
(Laughter) I was mentally preparing for skepticism and bureaucracy to people ask me, "But do you expect this little bubble, and yes, I didn't expect it, of course?"
But the scientist must often have cinism that characterizes you a certain mentality.
You will never do it, of course, because you don't have the rights, I've heard a lot of this kind.
This country, in fact, lacks a lot the sense of common good.
And it's about doing things because you think of helping, to improve a situation not only because it's not interested.
And here's it: for the days of you, this is a commission.
The most elderly you recognize it, as I'm an extraordinary commissioner, I say this because it's the rule that allowed me to be able to take people from the public administration.
In fact, the only thing I asked you is.
It's like the systems from inside don't become transformed, right?
We want to try to transform them with people out there, where the fact that they don't know the public administration.
It's an asset.
So, financially, we created a small team, I wanted a small team, I told you 25 people, and I didn't have a slight, it's a advantage and not a disadvantage.
Not big, but it's also too small: technological experts around 80% are expected to do legal judges.
The governative of communication.
Here you can see the post I had done by myself, I started this adventure.
I said, "Why don't we write?
What I think will happen.
In this way, we want to attract talents, talents that you live in Italy, or that you want to come back.
Also temporary.
It has a compensation, it's probably very good to do with what you see.
How do I tell you?
So I put myself in the idea, but how do I convince someone to do the same thing I'm doing?
On the other hand, maybe some of you recognize it, that photography of the worm of the beautiful, that in the '47s all the United States have put the children of the phone, all the United States, in this massive sport.
The vision of investment and infrastructure.
We created the vision.
The operative system of the country is a series of fundamental components to build simpler services, effective for citizens, public administration and companies.
Through innovative digital products.
The very beautiful vision of the implementation is the blood and blood.
I've continued, in my place, the soccer field in Salita, the American soccer, if I don't make mistakes.
And I continued, we will also have many rules, complicated, sometimes incomprehensible, it's a easy prediction.
We should learn to manage with intelligence and bureaucracy, many will say, don't understand how public administration works.
They've already tried it in many, they've failed, in Italy it doesn't work like that.
What's up?
We'll get many criticisms: some comments will be useful, others will be cinemas and prejudices.
The criticisms of the first type will make people who really want to offer their contribution, and we've found them a lot.
The second type of color they want to defend the state of the team is that they always see the bubble in the middle.
Or that, simplerly, the power is drawn.
This is a big problem.
To teach things that don't work.
Remember this image: the first, men and women on the cover of Time Magazin.
Here's it.
So, despite looking for the most possible people to do with the eye, I received about three,000 questions.
So, certainly, at least a centimeter, decently qualified, we've used digital tours for the Colloqui, an app called Jazz, we have it in the middle of the government, we've made a technological test in the technological part, the team has reached the mass, and now we're a little more alive, and has immediately started to operate, what do we do?
In fact, we take care of Draulica.
These are the tubes of the public administration, some of them to do a lot about connecting, because it's a big problem.
"Why?"
The systems, the processes, the applications, anything that should be interconnected, is "asylos" and doesn't connect.
And I'm not only talking about machine-machine, I'm also talking about people who don't want to explore their own data, their own applications.
And in years, to implement it, to connectivity, interruptability.
And sponsor the code of the public administration.
I can't focus on the software, of course, and do so many projects activities.
So, so much hydraulic activity.
But we can't also be pictures.
To make the services of the beach, you have to make them better, to make them easier, to make them easier.
All these things are done in parallel, but without the tubes you can't do it.
After a few months, in the midst of 2017 we wrote the piano "Trienna," the Administration Public, and we did it together with the agile of other people who helped us, what is it particularly about the trendial piano for the digital transformation of the publication?
In other words, there's one thing that exists.
Two.
It's written in a clear, technological way.
But also in the process.
It was the first time.
It has saved and sponsorized from the government, the anti-lon speaker has affected the decrease of the present in the minister, the digital transformation is a priority of the government, the triennal piano.
It's been newspaper once a year, because planes can't be static, especially in technology.
And it's appreciated to administrations.
What is this, this is the only way to do the piano in Italy, in the public administration?
The regulation remains the technical rules and read exactly three pains of view and connections from other norms to another ego, and at some point there are quite incomprehensible rules: unfortunately we can't abolish these things, but we can do it in parallel.
Other things, so the trendal piano.
It's put on the Internet, the technologies you understand it, it's put on shape where we can move.
To talk to the administrators, to make us give feedback, the documentary on the rhythm of Ox, in a way that the administrators themselves, the technologies to public administration and software can not exist.
To improve it.
We dedicate ourselves to this particular moment, and this is always the part of the piano.
There are the militant platforms, the digital platforms, they are those things that make all the activities of the public administration, the more there will be.
Digital payment is one: electronic cards, electronic letter, which is a habitant platform, the identity to digitalize a platform.
The major project we've followed is called the national and resilient population.
"Yes."
Let's put this.
Technologically, all the data of you, citizens, who are at this moment, are at 8,000 different sides, which are the 8,000 Italian communities, in the only database, synchronous.
Where data is talked about them, especially synchronized, and they talk to the rest of apps of the administration: when I'm transferred to a common to the other, I have to.
First of all, what I was managing, manually, then I have to go to the island, the motorization, to all those places, I have to say, all those things I've already had to know.
We're solving technological solution, then we'll do so much about processes.
Two weeks ago, we made a series Akaton.
where 800 software educators have worked on that brilliant application, they were used in 96 interventions.
Fixing, so, putting problems on software.
The improvement of documentary is even new projects.
It was made in 25 Italian cities.
Without Francisco, even if it's not Italian, but there are many Italians who are helping us from the technological point of view, out of the History.
All of this?
It reflects, and we're talking about sustainability and scalability in the beautiful place for such and such points, where they're exposed to all the documentary.
All the codes, but they always love more, the applications.
This is the Italian publication, now there will be a fifth of what would be left, maybe even in the middle.
The future is today, we dream a little.
I was also working on other projects that, financially.
They don't limit themselves to do hydraulic, they also enter the boat.
But it serves that the paintings are completed, sorry, I insist, this could be, for example.
And it's one of those things that embrace.
Because we'll leave the alsa aviation, we're digital citizenship.
"Oh, the phone!"
Smartphone has the digital identity, has the data of electronic identity, has NPR.
It's already functional.
And all of this, the goal is to make it easier, to familyize the interaction between citizens and the public administration.
The interface is simple.
We're dreaming a little, because of work we'll really do so much, but it's different from this vision.
A few weeks ago, the storm.
It's been around 150 years since the world has written an uncertainty.
They expect us a lot of people.
Talking about what they think can happen.
I asked you to talk about simplification of the lives of every day of the citizens.
I've taken the opportunity to write an article that I want to mention to you.
Some fish?
It's a desire or dream, maybe we do it.
We want a country where politicians who try to understand the digital transformation, instead of fearing it and fighting it, are the rule and not the exception.
A country where they read recognize and promote the right to innovate, to embrace it.
A country where technological skills are also inside the state and public companies.
A country where there are more public companies and private, guided by 30 years than 70.
Imagine, in the end, a country where working for public administration is a north, where better brains make money to work in public research centers, which are green and precisely the centers of excellence and innovation.
The door doesn't develop the country.
That's how a dream is.
And what are the components to do all this, process politicians?
Technological digitals are really many and maybe too many.
But if it's not a dream about which points are difficult, they can do things.
First to conclude.
This is my mom who belonged to the people who told me, "Who did you do it?"
(Audience) Yes!
And here it's due to some parts of this theater, among the other.
But at this point, it's more calm, and I couldn't explain what I'm doing.
And she also thinks how we, like Till, like the 25 kids of the digital Tinet, understood that what we are doing is like all those who believe us and want to do.
Anything.
And if you want information about us?
Our site and our social workshops.
Did you know the possibility to make a wish?
Just one to change a aspect of your life.
That doesn't go like you're going.
What would you change?
And what would you change, raise your hand if you would change your job, your genius, your own collaborators?
You're afraid, you're looking at you, you're going to see that, because here behind you know there's... Then raise your hand those who would change their own body, maybe lose some kilos.
Or maybe win them in muscles?
(Laughter) I'm sure that I wouldn't have taken all of them, or maybe you're the ones who would change part of it.
(Audience) Yes!
More times, during my life, I asked myself this question.
Let's not understand if you'll change the part, and the answer would be because the elementary ones would have a more united family, but the doctors weren't separated.
Thank you very much.
In the media, I would have wanted to be better, for the pleasure of the kids.
At Liceo, I wanted to feel the most complicated teachers, they seemed to me all the hostiles, and I was reflected in music, here the great void to make in the living room.
BB: Being the university would have wanted to work, but I found myself with the difficulty of access to the work market, so all the first part of my life I've been able to fight and fight to try to understand how to change the things that didn't go well, from what others thought of me, to the great economical hands, from the interpersonal relationships, to my characteristics and my acquired until the birth.
But when did they become a psychologist?
However, I looked at my research to other people, and I realized that they, like me, used mainly three strategies.
But these strategies, if you use them in a small dose, could also take some benefit, but if, as most cases happen, were the only three maps to play in front of a crisis.
Not only did they solve a good nulla, but they ended up maintaining their problems in life.
The strategy, today, is more diffused.
It's lamenting.
We lie a bit of everything, we lie it a little bit of everything, there's crisis, there's no work that's traffic, that's cold, that I'd have done in a different way, we lie to them because there's no justice, and this paralyzes you, typnotizes and alarms.
To the spots of eye.
I remember a girl who came to my studio, the one who didn't do anything else than to get hurt, the last work of the government that hadn't helped her, felt like a true ability, and now that she had completely colonized her daily life.
In other words, unfortunately.
For all of us, it's a bit the great attempt.
Because with a small effort.
You can get a great result.
To review the rule of the victim.
Because he was listened, comfortable, helped.
But beat well.
Can you lament the night or the day?
Only with friends, on the other hand.
Or in your mind.
And you can lament yourself of something that has already happened, or something that maybe one tomorrow could happen.
And you can lament yourself around you.
As many more often happens, you can lament yourself right.
Because we all have many reasons to be able to lament.
But the truth is that for how much you will make you hardly remember something around you, it will change, elderly, you won't do anything else than giving more attention to what you say.
If the strategy that for the villages, when things don't go as you would like, is to slow down.
They assume that someone is in the study of a B piano.
To save the legs.
Imbocate.
Another very objective strategy, when things are stretched, is to impose our need.
Because, at the base of this mentality, there's a growing cultural factor, based on which we learned that if something doesn't work well, it's enough to change it, we can manipulate our pleasure, what surrounds us.
Don't like the shadow?
But from the aesthetic circle.
(Laughter) You feel a little further, but why never be in the suffering?
We take two pillars and we solve it easy.
Would you want you to break?
It's divorce.
At fresh, we all agree how many risks to the palm.
"My son doesn't listen to you, Menalo."
It's too big to not register it, send it to the psychologist, we're here for this, on the other hand, my vocation, the choice for this profession, to make the world around you get involved in perfection with your demands.
But the environment inside which this strategy emerges in a very important way.
The relationships of coppy.
I remember one, a copy, during the collapse of which I didn't do anything else than listening to what, according to one, the other would have to change to solve the resources of their future.
He. He.
Yes, but of course you're to agree, but not even to prepare yourself in the Chinese.
It wasn't a classic.
And she, right?
If you don't look for me if not for that.
And he doesn't, you know, you don't realize all the things I do for you.
And she, "No, if you don't listen to me, otherwise you'll do another well to meet me, and so you'll see the infinity of a lovely iron that always begins with the same word stretched."
Because we have to show all the equation line of the other, we have to make them see all the problems that should be cured to reproduce our happiness that has kidnapped us.
(Laughter) But the truth is that if this thing we often say it in a good ugly, believing us deeply.
We can hardly change something, elderly.
Instead of choosing the node at the base of the relationship, we end up enriching them to heal them, if the strategy that privileges them.
When things don't go as you want, the one to impose your need and wait for others to modify the consequence, think about a pair of times, because I'll have a life.
full of resistance, full of hostility.
Third strategy: when things go in a way that doesn't like us, is it?
To make sure there's no way, like a building, take the head, put it under the ground.
At the base of this dynamic, there's the fear of facing the conflict that would emerge, that we should show our needs, and then what do we deal with them for the common good?
But in this way we don't even take a position, so we can't define ourselves in our identity.
And we live in the market, we need others.
I remember a young man in the young man, a young man in the young man, a son of separated parents, who, at the end of the first childhood, had learned to distress with great diplomacy between the tips of mom and dad, often spinning from the fear of one, would have lost the love of the other.
In this limited situation, we can't find it.
I learned important things, for example, in words.
To listen, to accept, to think about motivations among them, even distant from one from the other, but on the other hand, I've never learned to say no.
The things they didn't go well didn't learn to say no to the relationships they were going to look for, there were any relationship condition, and, elderly, it was one of those who had to always be media, but in this way they had to end their needs, their wishes, their ambitions, they were always supposed to tell you what.
It's the strategy that privileges, when things don't go like you're, is to suffer your needs.
First, your body will start to talk to you, and instead of all of you.
I'll end up failing.
In other words, lamenting.
In addition to their needs, or to suffocate them, there are three limiting strategies: I can say, with the means of cause, because I myself, throughout my life, has abused them, I tell you what happened to me.
One day, the first hospital I collaborated, sent me to call and said to me.
But Zuckeli, here for her, there's no longer place: if you like to continue the collapse with us, you have to accept a transfer.
And he told me a far away place, lost, detesitated from the most, or, above all, I would have to go there to make a job that didn't even enter a big deal with everything I had studied until then.
I felt like dying, okay, but it didn't make sense to lament myself.
Trying to make them change the idea, adopting, but sending that other, and even less because I've never had to accept a commitment that for me was unbearable.
There you go.
But having different results would have had to do different things.
For the first time, of course, on my legs, at that moment, I realized that the secret ...
To change others.
It's changing yourself.
If it was changed me.
The others would also be able to follow, modify, change.
And if it was a super brilliant, complete, unique psychologist, the first one wouldn't send me to travel.
It's also the same thing.
The thing wouldn't be stupid.
Let's see, maybe I've been going through me before I was the only one in Cachas.
But if I wasn't that person yet.
But the answer didn't go to the other's fault, but I had to introduce myself to the profound of my own.
Responsability.
Why things?
They don't change.
We are the ones who change.
And the first change we have to do?
It's in the address of choosing us.
What do you choose?
How does things cause?
That they don't go like you want.
You choose how things that are not going.
This is our bias.
If I never find the work of the crisis, you're putting the only arts to your disposal.
And now we'll find ourselves alone, in the hands, to face something too much bigger, I want to say, "It's the crisis's fault, what do you want to do?"
But if you're part of the Earth, and you think you're perfect, that maybe there's a change mark, then you open your doors in front of you, because it defines your responsibility, you do it, you can always decide to learn a new language, if you read books, to acquire new skills, to consolidate those that you already have, you can work on you to become unique.
Because life is those who do it.
Who doesn't do it?
He suffers it.
And if it's inside the copy, things don't go well, you think it's the other to do the first step.
It's sending you a message of inequality, and you're moving away, if you're part of you.
And maybe your own contributions, every day, this simple question.
What can I do today differently?
To make your best day.
So things change.
But they don't change, but they change because you're you who've changed before going to the research of their lacks.
Now she's looking for her needs.
And then I try to operate.
To be able to satisfy them.
And in this way, I create a mental space inside which we can take care of one another instead of making the war.
Audience: Yes.
You're one of those people.
It's clear that not only you're losing time, but you also lose the sense of meaning, the things you do.
If you start with yourself, to understand your needs, to try to understand which actions you put in the field to preserve them.
So the game becomes something inside which you can become the pattern of the age.
It's starting to work on me, considering myself a cause of the things that didn't go as I wanted, instead of their simple effect that I also started to have to be a better person.
When I was writing to the university, I had a dream: the dream of helping people to live better thanks to psychology, to understand them that, with my matter, there were practical tools, sometimes even fast to bring great value inside their lives.
But friends, I met with a couple of...
The problems?
Stereotypes, prejudices, psychologist is the doctor of the matters, the psychologist is the doctor of the debts, but he had to talk to a friend, but he went to the park.
What would I have to do?
I had to lament myself, or possible that I didn't tell you how beautiful psychology I had to try to change their mental priority, I had to drop my dream.
No, I had to.
To learn to speak a language, which was the one that didn't happen, as the agent closer, I had to learn to use new technological tools to communicate in a more efficient way, I had to learn to listen to their needs.
But what?
It imposes mine.
It's the turn of...
Little time, following this direction, I got results for me unimaginable.
When I finished my primary school and his transfer, I didn't sleep for three days and three nights, I didn't know what to do.
I thought about it, and it's finally decided.
I would have accepted the transfer.
But not as they understood it.
I'm transferred here.
I went home, I killed the computer, and I registered a video I carried on YouTube.
In which I spoke about psychology, here for the chronologist, I say I'll take a few launch.
Maybe he thought, "OK."
In a short time, my YouTube channel has become a reference point in Italy for what psychologists look at in video thanks to this thing every day thousands of people are approaching the psychology putting in discussions some of the stereotypes I mentioned before.
Recently, a review that from 1974, I'm in 79: I share psychology in Italy, asked me to become a director, and today, every two months, in the best schools, in Italy, leaves my review, and what has touched me more about everything.
It was the recognition that the colleagues, at first a little strange, wanted...
I had to let myself down.
Because, obviously, they saw that my attempt to innovate the profession in a way to communicate it had something sense, and in Lombardia I was read to the vice-president of them.
The dreams.
They don't become reality, why?
For example, fortunately, or because you've had that.
The theory that must have is the one that keeps moving forward, who doesn't know how it is built and needs to distrugle you, because the culprit should do it.
And also so much, you should discuss your identity, your points of belonging to your certainties, your rooms of yourself.
And if there's something I learned from all this inner journey.
Audience: Yes.
It's that the most important transition.
This is the most delicate, but also the most urgent.
It must come to our internal.
Ten minutes ago I asked you a question.
If we had the chance to express a desire, only to change a aspect of life.
What would you change?
I've talked about work.
The physical aspect of the short story.
Well, in fact, I'd like to leave you with a gift: how much less try it, it's a small question that was personally very useful to me.
And that's based on logic that, to get to produce big changes, we have to focus on many small actions.
What's the thing?
And easier.
That you could do until now, until the end of the afternoon, to return home after this beautiful newspaper.
And that will allow you to take the first step.
To put it.
Your life in the direction?
That's where you auspicize.
You can think, "What is the smallest, the simplest thing you can do?"
To put your life in the direction.
It's true.
"I have your keys of the fridge, I have to send them."
Or do you do it now, leave the pull, right?
But where do you put the bags?
Fairy, markets are the prove.
Obviously, now I call you.
I'm ugly that it's time to change.
You can see when my mother comes.
Do you know something?
TED gave me the chance to talk for eight minutes.
And what is this?
I want to take this time by myself.
I had a dream.
To create a integration band.
A lot of diversity and diversity.
The percussions are so fast.
That's how you see.
They take the distances and unite the battles.
Are we leaving?
We are predicted in seven.
You're young, I see them, I see Laura, Paola.
Daniel.
I saw them grow.
Our tests were the marketing.
On the other hand, it was the day of evidence, where it was entering this city.
Studying in the Music of Andreoli.
They were placed in the first bidons.
It was together.
The first waves together.
Then we decided to become a good mark.
From that moment on, we increased 7, 10, 12, 14.
We decided to make the first musical brands and travels: the first brands in the pieces, the first satisfaction, the first ones.
Uncontrol.
The first satisfaction?
For the kids, for us, for everything we were doing.
But above all, the first applause.
Unfortunately.
One night of the 20th of 2012, the world fell down.
The real sense of the word.
All the cases were completely unbearable or crowned: a strong earthquake scope made our earths.
And from that moment on, we were.
The earthquakes of the thousands.
For all the inequalities, we were called this.
As I said, the houses were...
Not more agible.
Many crossed: our proof, our place where?
Where there were all the Martians, it was completely distrustful.
The tools were inside.
What did we do?
I, the Sahara, Marco, Fede, Matteo.
We looked for everything.
You have them in doppoli.
And the road?
We were able.
Luckily, we found everything.
We're all finished inside a tender, in a tender, in the thirst of magnificent, of the end of the media.
In that tenderness?
There are magnificent things.
We've seen fear sounding stronger.
Because the bathroom of the bathroom sounds stronger than the earthquake: we looked at ourselves in the eyes.
With the Earth that was shaking?
To look for...
A smile.
A look.
It's the land shaking.
I'm just there.
We built the first tools.
The scary cests.
They became houses in the bank.
The tubes that have become.
The tools built and suited with ping pong racks.
It's about removing them with big houses, crossed.
We were constantly.
In continuous work, always, there was an amazing energy.
Although we were at a terrible moment.
The inside was born in our first protocol.
We decided ...
To put on a real sponsor.
However, the group's components were increasing, the friends passed the word.
From 20, we were, we became 25, 30, 40, 50.
We are part of the construction of the first protocol: the white.
Because there were the smallest loops, the biggest loops and the white genius.
At that moment, everyone was moving together.
Like a luxury white man.
Then, immediately after.
What did we do?
Last year, we did the high sponsorship, the curve.
We became all the Marines.
Because we really wanted to navigate.
And to move a moment to our Earth.
To breathe for a moment.
That year later we made a crack, this marine monster.
Is it immediately after?
50 speakers, this flywheel.
And to conclude, that of this year, the sea of the Moon.
The sea of the Moon.
We wanted to stop a second on this Moon and look.
The sea.
There were many things inside this tenderness.
And none of us would never have thought that it's a tender?
It could change life.
We did it.
But I want to tell you something.
20 minutes are finishing.
Everything we've done in these seven years really seems to me a favola.
150 concerts in turn for the adventure.
The first magician's stage?
The concert in the TV program at home.
Is it the lack of material?
And we really did many.
And also to me, smelling for the voices, because this is exactly me.
It's exactly the scenery of life.
The one of the factory, the sweat, but also.
This is the freshness.
That it's so much possibility to the future.
What happens when a dream?
It becomes reality.
Now I have to come back from the fruits.
They expect me.
Is there still so much?
And to build.
Thank you all.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Good afternoon.
My name is Maria Cristina Firradini, and in fact I was born as a lawyer, until the moment I asked myself what happened in the last 250 years.
I'm ...
250 years very important that changed radically our history, and that we live currently.
What is social innovation about?
And my question is: What is this social innovation?
And above all, our Italy, which is often so biased, is a ready country to incorporate this digital innovation, and ready to be tested at its time of innovation.
But this is the digital metamorphosis: we all take it to us, close to us, an object, I believe so everything.
The phone is a technological solution that belongs to the industrial revolution, it's a very evolving computer, and the computer belongs to it.
The revolution is the Internet, and it's connected, and once again, this is an invention of the internal revolution of the Internet phase in our history, and yet these three factors together, united to mobility, make us enter a new time.
But let's try to understand then what happened in these 3 in these 250 years, that summarize.
The Industrial Revolution, the Internet revolution and the Internet soldiers, we probably remember it as a Ferrovia.
What did we study?
I'm on the school's book, in fact, it wasn't just a beer: we, at the industrial revolution, are enormously debates, for example, because we need the vapor motor.
And the vapor motorcycle isn't just a vapor motorcycle, but it's, for example, with the tool that has favored and has resulted much faster, the carbon station.
And the network is possible to a very inferior cost, and then the vapor motorcycle has entered the corners, has entered the founders, and has started to change the modality, but they don't make it happen.
But we don't only have the motorcycle.
The vapor, we also need the scope motorcycle, because, on the other hand, it's an Italian invention, it's a scope motor.
For example, we need the automobilistic industry.
In fact, before the Christmas industry, because the motorcycle was a motorcycle that couldn't go from fertile, when they were able to understand how to get that scent to realize it, and it became that scent that has developed the automobilistic industry, which is all that has derived.
But I'm not.
In the Industrial Revolution, we are still in users, for example, for the phone: the phone is not only with the tool that allowed us to avoid continuing to see our letters from one part to the other of the world, always more than they knew.
But is it also what has allowed us?
He taught us to deposit the caves.
Sout the sea.
And yes, because then it was the phone, we couldn't try it in the sea, and then what did we do?
We interrupted everything.
We went forward, standing on the sea, the first cavity, to give you a storal dimension, was taken from Italy between medicine and registered the beach, not just two populations that came from agreement, but the first cavity was there.
And we are around 1858.
But there's the phone.
The phone, we still live it today, we know what it is, we use it, brings it to our voice, in 187900 subscribed to Rome.
It's only 1877.
Another intention is electric energy, the first electrical central.
The continental, in Europe, was built via Santa Radagonda, where there is the Milan Renaissance.
Today there's the teenager, there, a time in 1873 was built the first electric center.
In that year, on December 30th, it was lit to the scale.
A part of our history was born exactly there.
Let's move forward, let's try to make some more long salts, and we get to 1950: we're going forward, we're already getting to know a certain agency, for another, a century.
It's still in the course, but that has already lived important staffs, and also important emotions from a cultural point of view, but it begins to be born something, to compose something that has never been in the story before: they are the computer, which are calculators.
Three colors who, at the beginning of the '50s, were able to stay in a stadium like this, and they had functions of neurocarcle: they were simply faster, the car.
But they went forward and evolving in a more significant way, always more structured, more intelligent, and they became intelligent contributors, they started to be the artificial intelligences we know.
But in these 50 years of the Internet revolution, there were few others, there were research institutions, and above all, there were scopes of all the defenses that have brought to develop underground reactions, but not underground because they were not known.
At some point.
It's decided to open these laws.
And these challenges, called ARPA, the network.
They became and started to be the website that we know.
There was a diffused, or horizontal system, not hierarchical, extremely captured, capable of bringing information, in 1981 there were only 395 computers connected to the Internet.
Not many.
But today it's in the orders of thousands, because we're not talking about the computers we use, but of all these intelligent systems that connect to the network to care about data, to pick up data or to work for data.
But when is the mechanical strength?
It was, as a say, replaced by the industrial revolution.
It started to include the Artificial Intelligence of the Computers.
And mobility?
And the Internet has had the time that, if we started to live the time we've lived now, that we're living now, the one that's called the Internet, and this second, a phenomenon of creative destruction.
I'm financially an industrial process that tells us that what is new, progressively, constructs what is old, because we need to do space, and we'll see better then how.
But this is the story of the great numbers, of the great inventions, but there's a story that is a little more human, that belongs to us a little more, on which I try to make a reflection, I try to accompany you.
It was 1863, when, little by little, the Italy hasn't made the Italians yet.
The Minister Mingetti, put in the Finances Mingetti, establishes that the 27th of the Middle Ages, is corresponded to the payment and public dependents.
And from 27 to the next months, this happens.
And at this moment, even if we don't realize it, we're introducing mini strangers, something extraordinary.
But before the richer of a family, more than a single, she was in her ability to produce good services that were necessary for her own support.
With the safety of the payment, the certainty of the payment, the fact that the payment was less risky of the stages, less risky of the elevation, it started in some way to move away from the Earth.
What about it?
It has transformed the economic power to produce.
In goods and services, in the power of production of one.
Well, the dwarf.
But there's a second aspect.
What is the security?
But for us women, obviously, it was a revolution that has enough to read.
But what was the fridge in fact?
It's not only that object that frees us from the audience to go and do the spirit every day, but also this industrial system that allows us to preserve.
In a massive way, a structured way in a healthy way, in quantities of food.
So, there's the possibility, once again, to focus on something that isn't.
Immediately, the use of everyday life.
But this is the man who begins.
To live to the end of November, these are us.
And in time, how did we say it?
They came to the computer and arrived on the Internet, and then there's a figure that has characterized these years, which is an element that we can define as the qualifier of these years: speed.
We, 250 years ago, weren't fast as we are today, today we do the speed of the challenges, the speed of the movements, the speed of our movement, and also the speed of our thinking that is not the quality of thinking, but we are very fast.
But until then something happened.
It's typically true when you look at the story, to understand the passengers of a century to the other, and sharing data that are not necessarily zero.
In 1900, 1900 and 2000, when we can say that it's finished the 20th century, I believe, but this is really an orbitrary event that is two data that is significantly signed in the passage of an episode, from one another: 2001 and 2001.
The American economy started to slow down, and on the other hand, there were Torri Gemelli, and so something in balance has started to change, these equilibrium that seemed solid, we realized that they were very fragile.
But we went forward until there was something that has slowed all the time, the biggest economic crisis that the Western world, and the oriental world together, had never met, there was no only America to have slowed, almost closed, there was also the orientation.
In other words, there were Europeans who were to fail, the Greek was already the leaves of failure, they don't talk to us, but still there.
And it changed something.
But what has changed, the economic paradigm has changed, we couldn't.
Don't wait for the biggest economic crisis that, in fact, was verified in 2008 and was crazy not to think about it, but how could we not imagine a crisis of this dimension when we can do everything?
With many less people.
It was obvious that it would be cool.
We were blind, we didn't know how to wait, look at these companies.
And this is a company.
Because they are stable multinationalities, in their majority, but above all, they are all companies that are Dante after 2011.
What did these companies do, don't they innovate?
inventing something, they didn't innovate building something that before there was, but they started to do what we've always done, to buy, to travel, to learn.
Take it.
The different way, the most efficient way.
And what about it?
It's so often denied.
Let's try to look at the state of health and digital details: according to five factors, connectivity, we're 10 percentual points under the media, but honestly we're almost close to a fast connection for 50 percent, and so much and little.
Anyway, something, according to human skills, human resources, competences of curving it, of a different being, between advancing and basic skills, the vast competences of what allow us to flow.
These are the informatic systems of digital systems, those advances that allow us to develop them.
And a third picture we have to look at is the use of the Internet, we have it, but we use it.
A third, a fourth element.
It's the inclusion of the digital factor in productive processes.
So, comets, or industrialization of products and services, the fifth is digitalization.
The system of public administration: we immediately choose the field of some ambiguity, and we maintain the only two that are important: above all, a good news for everyone, all the five elements are increased.
These are all the five elements that are in a growth, in a growth speed, completely in an attempt until two years ago, so we're lying the European countries, and this doesn't work.
But, on the other hand, with activity, we said it in ten points outside.
But, basically, it's enough to look at the newspapers, you'll see who.
We're growing fast, there are new in exchange between new operators, new competitions: we're building a very important and competitive fabric, the use of them, and we're really connected.
In fact, a very profound change was born that is aligned to the European standards: there are two factors that we have to look at with great attention that will be key for our future of countries and are the skills and the inclusion of the digital in brutal factors.
And in this way we have to pay a lot of attention to the characteristics of our country, we have two engines.
The first driver?
It's what made the Italy in the '50, there are the small companies.
But far from being, the little media.
Something not useful, not effective, not paragonable to large multinationals, in fact.
I'm probably the most effective entrepreneurial tool to interceive the speed of change: they're agile, they're fast, they're small.
And they know how to do something extraordinary that the Made in Italy has an excellence in the production of service, in the production of products.
It's pretty unique in their DNA, we all want it.
The only thing we have to do is to acquire, insistently, competences inside these realities, because these realities can become those multinationals that can serve.
A whole segment.
The market, the extraordinary way, generating richerness for the whole tissue around you, and this is the first assault we have, the first big motorcycle, the second motorcycle that is in Italy, is its cultural artistic heritage.
In other words, a heritage that nature, for her existential nature, thanks to God, is an analog heritage, and will get an analog heritage: we can't digitalize the crop.
But is it possible that tourists?
Not only three cities.
The Venezuela, the Rome, and then the birth.
But the wealth of these three cities don't make the wealth of our country.
And we're learning, maybe we've tried to start, but we're fast to recover, to include.
This heritage inside a knowledge system that allows us to carry it, to make it notice, and to bring tourism not only to visit three centers, but to visit all our country.
I believe that this is the greatest urge we can do in our Italy.
It has decoded me.
I'd talk about it in a certain sense and the opposite action of the word.
What does it mean?
What is all this?
Our encounter is the opposite of the word "share," because I'll talk not about sharing, but in a certain sense of the opposite of sharing, which is inequality.
I'll talk about inequality, I'd like to start first.
With a question.
But if someone asked you?
Let's fight for it.
Secondly, in the last ones.
15, 20 years old.
Let's say, in the 21st century.
The inequalities in the world, the inequalities of law between the citizens of the world are increased or decreased.
But I believe most of you will answer.
I'm increased, if you were journalists, maybe you'll get there.
The objective, let's think.
I'm increased exponentially.
And that's me.
I asked you, "But is it in Italy?"
Perhaps the answer of many would also be.
I asked myself these questions in the last few years and with...
Only the 24th is the foundation of video.
I prepared with my friends a report.
In inequalities, from when they are artists, that is, financially, from 1960.
For the biggest majority of the countries in the world.
"Yes."
The result is what ...
This is the curve.
From the development of inequality, directly between the citizens of the world, as you can see, there was indeed an increase of inequalities, especially in the 80s, but from now on.
From the end of the last century, in the end of the 90s.
The compessive inequality between the citizens in the world is crowned and precipitated, now we're at the least story.
In Italy?
In Italy, we must understand that inequality is quite complicated, even here we have an increase throughout the 80s, but in the last 20 years, practically from the beginning of the second public.
AC: We have a trend of inequality of growth.
How can we read these data?
Well, a possible reading is to say, "We've traveled a collective bathroom because we continue to talk about years of argument of inequality, how much data doesn't support our feeling.
And there's really, surely, in this reading, but we could also ask ourselves another question: What if the feeling of an increase of inequalities that many of us?
Let's see!
(Laughter) It wasn't wrong the feeling, but it was wrong the idea of inequality on which.
We reason.
Perhaps.
We must reflect on the issue of inequality, on what we understand.
For inequality.
Maybe the concept of inequality?
It requires some rethink.
We leave this question temporary and we move around a century.
And also, let's move to Cambridge in 1928.
A year before the great crisis of the 29th, Lickens.
Because it was Cambridge, there was a speech in front of you.
It has a student audience, a speech that has become famous with the title "The economic possibility for our grandchildren," in that occasion, Keynes forms two professions.
The first says.
It's a century, productivity.
But one hour to work will be...
Other times the one of today, that is 1928.
And this trade, in fact, is made because if you went to take it.
The reconstructions of the stories of the economy.
Indeed, most of the advanced society, we have an increase of productivity in the turn of 100 years, which is also said.
Ten, 12 times, in some case, 15 times, so this teacher was fulfilled, but from this Keynes teacher also needed a consequence, an idea, which is humanity.
Little by little, that is, it's been lost for a few years, it would be found with a huge amount.
The free time that would have it to...
To work less.
And he also said, to work everyone, and when he said, at least, he understood a week of 15 hours of work.
I have a three-hour work time a day.
And he saw a problem for this, because the question that was asked Keynes, but with all this free time we knew how to use it well or not.
Okay.
Apparently, this second thirsty hasn't been made.
Because we all see it, that we don't all work, and it doesn't seem exactly what we work three hours a day.
I don't know.
I make you notice that this teacher is divided in two parts: no one who says we will all work, it's certainly false, but the first part.
We'll work a lot less, we'll work three hours a day, we're sure it's not done anywhere, we'll see what happened in Italy.
That's it.
This curve, or this trajectory, represents the time fraction.
It's an Italian, medium.
It's dedicated to work throughout your life.
Your life is naturally potentially working, that is, for 15 years, then when we are ...
In order to compare a job, well, if we look at this trajectory, the prophecy of Keynes is actually made.
Because we were at the beginning of Christmas, almost 40% of the time of our lives working.
And now we call it around 16% and the interesting thing is that this 16%.
"Fa."
Two hours and a room a day, that is, the barrier of the three hours, in Italy, we've already screwed it.
Surely?
If this happened, there are also reasons.
Obviously, and if you want a bank, for example, the old age is enormously aligned.
Because we die very much after the life expectancy, and those who succeeded in something like 27 years from the beginning of the last century, from 900, there's another reason, then our children often study long, they also study for 25 and 30 years, so the youth has also been aligned.
But there's a more fundamental reason why.
Our quote of time?
Dedicated to work and crowned.
And it's!
The crop of the occupation rate, that is, the number of people.
What job?
This is the historical series of total occupation.
It's built for this occasion.
And this dramatic series, because it makes you see, what?
At the beginning of the century, in all the monarchical era, before the Second World War, the occupation taste was to direct.
I hope more than 70 percent.
Today we're very low, we're around 50 percent scarce, elderly.
From 1968 and except one year.
The occupation rate has always been inferior to 50%.
But a occupation task?
In fact, 50 percent.
What does it mean?
It means that there are more people who don't work, who don't work, that is, pure consumers who don't perceive any network.
OK, I'll work.
In front of this?
In fact, storal, we can also have a reaction.
It's enthusiastic and say, "But what is this?
The progress, beauty, is modernity.
Things went like this because we can allow it, but then we see if, in the country that the modernity's problem, that is in the United States, things have been in the same way, because if this interpretation is fair, it should have happened in the United States, and then we see the confrontation.
Let's go.
Italy.
It was united.
This is the storal series of time.
It's dedicated to work in life, as you can see, and the United States only waves up to the 30s, then it's established, and it's a reading tendency to the increase while it's from us.
But even more impressive, it's the storal series of the occupation rate, because here we see.
There's an increase, that small one you see below is the crisis of the 29th, we have a general tendency of the occupation rate in the United States at the increase, but in our case we have a situation.
Reducation.
The occupation task.
But then, this one?
In Italy, it's a pathology.
It's not normal.
"What? What? What?"
They are more people who consume without producing than the people who produce.
It's not normal that the majority of the population lives in a condition that I'll define.
"Dipendency parassitary," "dependence," because it depends on the network of your Wisia.
This, you can also be a family, the State.
But why do I consume it?
I have the right to be available without working.
I'm a friend who does theater's act.
When did I find these results?
We were in the chairs and I asked them.
And you, how would you represent this situation with an image, a situation of parasitary dependence?
And he knew what he answered to me.
With the hypothesis and that lights.
It lives on the sphere of the hypothesis, but it's called buffago, some say buffaga, here it is.
If you want to have an idea of how you behave.
The bubble or the bubble on the prototype, or on the other big mammals, these birds also live on the broken rivers, on the bubbles, well, we have this thread.
That will treat us for a few seconds, in which you can see.
These...
These fish, these fish.
How do they live?
By sitting on the resources, what?
The bubble provides it, which are in sects, the tree, and that everything that albergs on the bubble, is not clearly clear if the bubble is contained by the light bulb.
Anyway, it's.
This is the sociologist, so the question I've asked myself as a sociologist.
It's another: how can we define a situation of this kind, how do we define a society in which there is a majority of pure consumers and a minority of producers?
There's this kind of productive consumption, the first one I said to myself, "But this is the ignorant society?"
Society, ladies and gentlemen, as a feudal society in which there's a ceiling that has put in the condition of living without working.
But, naturally, it's not enough: you have to add a qualification.
What could be defined?
The ladies and gentlemen society, but it's a mass society.
Audience: Yes!
Because consumers are more producers.
In society, it's simple, classic: we have the gentleman and the jungle serves that produce for him, in society.
And here the report is clear: it's a relationship of commanding and subtomission: in mass society, things are a little more complicated, gentlemen have become many.
Because the relationship between the signs and the producers is much more complicated: Greek Dubezon, a great psychologist, would have defined it a relationship of Oppio Legame, we see why.
The relationship?
And from bubble with the hypothesis, it's from parasitism, and this is a advantage signed in green, but it's also dependence, because it depends on food that is found.
On the sphere of the hypothesis: the red light indicates a disadvantage.
And also from the point of view of the producers, we have again a red fresh, a green fresh, the autonomous hypothesis doesn't need bubble.
Because we can't, we can't nourish the birds that live on their spices, so the situation is very complex, and this is a situation of legacy, but a situation.
That doesn't go well.
Is it a situation in which?
"Wow!
A new problem of inequality, and now we get there.
The question I had asked about Keynes: today, perhaps, the real inequality and the inequality of access to work?
The access to work is very similar to our social system, but if inequality is access to work, we can use the tools of the analysis of inequality, that is to calculate a concentration of genius, which is the tool with which they measure inequality, we can apply to work, there are people who don't work, who have two jobs.
And the position of the History, in this scale of inequality of access to work, is dramatic: the position of the History is to be penous in the graduation together.
It's Turkey.
In the country where inequality reaches the maximum, but simply because there's the exclusion of women, if we were a Islamic country, we would probably have the palm of this creator, the best situation, the one of Norway, with the United States, in the middle.
They need us to become a normal country, seven million jobs positions.
How did we get to this, this is the story?
The inequality of access to work in Italy is always measured in any kind of genius, you can see something clamorous that inequality is the minimum during the work positions in more, our families.
They would perceive it.
In more than 1,000 euro per month, we would have 12,000 euros of round, in more.
At the year.
And our state would have 150 billion euros to spend as much as the health and the school has put together, more or less in Italy, but here there's a per√≤t.
Nights.
We have the scholarship to write in the first article of the Constitution, the History is a democratic Republic based on work, we are the only country.
It has this in the first title of the Constitution, and we are the worst country together with the Turkey of the West.
That's why.
Or we change things.
And we create the seven million jobs they lack.
Or maybe it's better to cancel the article one of the Constitution.
Because, being so, things sound like a bubble.
Thank you.
